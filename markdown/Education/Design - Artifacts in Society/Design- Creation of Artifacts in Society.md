What is Design?
---------------

Design happens when a human being observes or senses a problem, or a gap where the user experience is negatively impacted, and they define the problem, explore alternatives, and make a four-step iterative process to solve that problem.

What are the Four Steps in an Iterative Design Process?
======================================================

Plan
====
*Problem Definition:* What are the problems?
*Exploration:* Research all the ways the problem can be solved. Exploration is fundamentaly divergent to understand the full space of possibilities. As you explore more options you gain more clarity into the problem definitions which will give you more areas to explore.
*Select the Plan:* Converge your ideas to the best solutions.

Great design is iterative from great designers that worked on the same problems before.

Establish expectations for the artifact in a [spec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)), which is also something you will improve upon later.

##Assignment 1.1
A photograph and brief summary of an artifact that I love using every day.

I purchased a [Saddleback thin leather briefcase](http://i.imgur.com/r8ZWQOj.jpg) a few years ago to carry my design tools around in and it has become an artifact I would find it difficult to live without. The artifact is a well designed utilitarian piece, as well as a subjectively beautiful example of artistic craftsmanship. I love everything about the experience of using it, from the many pockets to store important items, to the heavy and high-quality leather construction which protects the important artifacts contained within.

##Assignment 1.2
Identify 10 gaps throughout the day and star one to use as a course project. Place that chosen gap on the [My Gap](/my-gap) page and briefly explain why it was chosen.

* The check engine light on my car should tell me what caused it to turn on. Was it low tire pressure? Is the gas cap not secure? Is there a problem with the transmission? etc...

* The paper towel dispenser in the gym locker room has a motion sensor that is difficult to engage. Lots of silly hand-waving happens each morning.

* When my smartphone switches from wifi to 4g all data transmissions are interrupted. If I'm on a phone call it will be dropped.

* Prioritizing and completing a major task each day is difficult with my current method of task scheduling (calendars, trello, to-do list apps like clear, emailing myself the task, etc) makes that difficult.

* If I want to accomplish important tasks during the day my current method of task scheduling (calendars, trello, clear, etc) makes that difficult. because I never remember to check all those resources as much as I'm checking my email. I end up emailing myself important tasks for the day which isn't very efficient on mobile (open email app, select new email, select account to send to, select account to send from, enter subject, optional message, no option for reminder notifications, difficult for long term management of tasks, isn't very fun)

* The wheels on my toddler's stroller randomly lock due to the locking mechanism engaging when a small piece of plastic is pressed down. Over time gravity has worn down this plastic, so it falls down on its own now.

* My coffee bean grinder is too loud in the morning and wakes up everyone in the house.

* The edges of my laptop are sharp, so any extended period of typing cuts into my wrist and is uncomfortable.

* The software I use to manage finances automatically logs me out after only five minutes of inactivity. It also requires an absurdly long password that needs to be retyped a dozen times a day.

* The cable connection on my Wacom drawing tablet sticks out very far and is also on the right side so my dominant hand rubs against it while drawing. 

* The curb going up to my driveway is not slanted enough which causes the front of my vehicle to scrape if I don't back out slowly at an angle.
