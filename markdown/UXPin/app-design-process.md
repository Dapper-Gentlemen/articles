#Recognizing the Problem

The first step in the design process is to recognize that there is a problem. This isn't easy and many times the problem you think you recognize isn't the root of the problem at all. If there is a river that needs crossing, for example, the problem isn't that there is a river, but that there is not a way to cross the river. 

If you identify the problem as the existence of the river what are your options to cross it? Maybe you could divert the flow of the river, or damn it up, or some other way to elimnate the river. These are solutions you could design but how efficient would these solutions be to execute upon? 

The solution to the problem of there not being a way to cross the river (instead of the existence of the river) could be to build a boat, or a bridge. By recognizing what the actual problem is we as designers are able to design and build a solution to that problem. So how do you effectively recognize the problem?

First we start with the perceived problem. This is about the UX design process for a mobile app, so we aren't going to use the example of the river. Instead we will use an example of a problem I find myself constantly experiencing that I would like to find a solution for. The problem is a lack of mental focus. 

**Problem Definition:**
*It is difficult to focus on my current task.*

The problem of lacking mental focus appears too general to design an app around. We could design an app that is a todo list to help focus on our current task for example. The problem here is we aren't tackling the root of the problem, which we haven't identified yet. Why would I be able to focus and commit on using a todo list app if I can't focus on the task itself? What is the root of my inability to focus? A todo list might address things like forgetfulness or prioritizing, but it is dependent on me having the discipline and focus of managing the todo list. So how can we quickly identify the root of the problem?

##The Five Whys Technique

> For Want of a Nail  
> For want of a nail the shoe is lost;  
> For want of a shoe the horse is lost; For want of a horse the rider is lost; For want of a rider the battle is lost;  
> For want of a battle the kingdom is lost; And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.  
> â€” [George Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert)

The [Five Whys Technique](http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf) is an iterative question-asking technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem to help you find the root cause of that problem. There are three things to keep in mind when using this technique: https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=the+five+why+methodology&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

- Accurate and complete statements of problems
- Complete honesty in answering the questions
- The determination to get to the bottom of problems and resolve them

Start with the problem statement.


Why is broader
How is more focused

This forces the designer to focus on what level of abstraction is most appropriate for solving this problem.

Reasons to be more general:
It opens up more opportunities to explore.
If you are too general you will not have the resources to make a measurable difference for that problem. The key is to make it slightly more general than you are comfortable with, but not so general that you feel you have no way to make a measurable difference.

Interview people with that experience the same problem that you do.

##The Problem Definition
A single statement that captures the scope of the problem we are trying to solve.
