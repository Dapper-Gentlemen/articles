##To Become Smarter

###To stay updated on the latest trends
Part of being smarter is staying updated on the latest industry trends and news. Ideas and trends aren't static, they are in a constant state of change and they evolve with the community.

##To Belong
[We are social creatures](www.google.com) but not all of us do well in social situations. Online communities can give users the ability to try out different identities and personas and get a feeling for who they really are. Online communities can provide one of the basic human needs, the need to belong.
###It helps to define the user's identity
When we are younger we don't yet know who we really are. Many people can go most of their lives without really knowing who they are. Self-actualization is a constant search as our ideas of self are always changing. By being part of a community users can take experiences and advice from members of that community and relate them to their own ideas about self.
