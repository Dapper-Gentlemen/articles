#Recognizing the Problem

The first step in the design process is to recognize that there is a problem. This isn't easy and many times the problem you think you recognize isn't the real problem at all. If there is a river that needs crossing, for example, the problem isn't that there is a river, but that there is not a way to cross the river. 

If you identify the problem as the existence of the river what are your options to cross it? Maybe you could divert the flow of the river, or damn it up, or some other way to eliminate the river. These are solutions you could design but how efficient would these solutions be to execute upon? 

The solution to the problem of there not being a way to cross the river (instead of the existence of the river) could be to build a boat, or a bridge. By recognizing what the actual problem is we as designers are able to design and build a solution to that problem. So how do you effectively recognize the problem?

First create a problem definition with the perceived problem. A *problem definition is a single statement that captures the scope of the problem we are trying to solve*. So what is the problem? This is about the design process for a mobile app, so we aren't going to use the example of the river. Instead we will use an example of a problem I would like a solution for that I can research and design an app to help solve. The problem I think I want to solve is *a feeling of too much stress*.

##Original Problem Definition

**I have too much stress.**

The problem of having too much stress and wanting to reduce it is probably too general to design a solution around. How many different ways can you think of to manage stress? Maybe you have a glass of wine at night, or a bottle, or listen to music, or maybe you can't even recognize when you are stressed and have no way of dealing with it. 

How many of these solutions would work for other people? Is having too much stress really the problem, or is it just a symptom of a much deeper problem. It is important to discover the root of the problem, and to do that we can use something developed at Toyota during the design of its manufacturing methodologies known as the [Five Whys Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys).

##The Five Whys Technique

> For Want of a Nail  
> For want of a nail the shoe is lost;  
> For want of a shoe the horse is lost;  
> For want of a horse the rider is lost;  
> For want of a rider the battle is lost;    
> For want of a battle the kingdom is lost;  
> And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.  
> â€” [George Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert)

The [Five Whys Technique](http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf) is an iterative question-asking technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem to help you find the root cause of that problem. Why is it important to find the root of the problem? It is important to find the root cause of the problem because solving a symptom isn't a permanent solution. If your leg hurts you could take painkillers to dull the pain, but you will not be fixing the root of the problem, just a symptom. If you went to the doctor and she determined that your leg hurt because you broke a bone, you could address the broken bone, which is the root of the pain problem. To use [the Five Whys Technique](http://www.shmula.com/jeff-bezos-5-why-exercise-root-cause-analysis-cause-and-effect-ishikawa-lean-thinking-six-sigma/987/) to determine the root of our problem, we first start with our original problem:

**I have too much stress.**

Now it is time to start asking and answering the *whys*.

**1. Why do I have too much stress?**  
*...because I have too many stressful thoughts.*
**2. Why do I have so many stressful thoughts?**
*...because I can not calm my thoughts.*
**3. Why am I unable to calm my thoughts?**
*...because I don't practice calming my thoughts.*
**4. Why am I unable to practice calming my thoughts?**
*...because I do not have a process to calm my thoughts.*
**5. Why do I not have a process to calm my thoughts?**
*...because I'm not aware of myself enough to know I need one.*

And so, the root cause of my problem of having too much stress is that I don't have a process to practice calming and focusing on my thoughts in an effort to remove the stressful thoughts when they arise. They key to understanding the root cause of the problem (it isn't always answered with the 5th why) is in identifying a broken process or an alterable behavior. In this example, calming my thoughts would lead to less stress, which solves the original problem. Being more aware of my true self is an interesting challenge that I may want to explore and would go deeper into fixing the original problem of having too much stress. I will add it to the new problem definition and if it proves to be too far out of scope I can always remove it and focus only on calming my thoughts to reduce stress. Design is about exploring ideas and changing what doesn't work after all. Time to iterate on our original problem definition.

**New Problem Definition:**
*I want to become more aware of my true self in an effort to calm my thoughts, reduce my [stress]((http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-symptoms/art-20050987)), and become a better person.*

So what is a solution that can be designed to practice focusing my thoughts? I should start doing some research to better answer that question.
