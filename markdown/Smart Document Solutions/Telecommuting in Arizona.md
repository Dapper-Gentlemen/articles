#Telecommuting in Arizona

Back in the day working life was pretty simple. You commuted to a job which could take thirty minutes to an hour one way. You worked your eight-hour shift and then you commuted back home.   In the mid 90's a thing called the Information Super-Highway, or internet began to get popular. I think [Al Gore]() invented it, or maybe it was [DARPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA). Either way, the *interwebs* created the unique ability for people to communicate with others across the globe, reducing the need for people to be in the same room with each other to accomplish their work.
  
Given the fact that you can now connect with people all around the world with technology like [Google Hangouts](), [Skype](), [Periscope]() and now [ryver]() the concept of telecommuting has become extremely popular for a multitude of reasons. A recent [study from Stanford](http://www.stanford.edu/~nbloom/WFH.pdf) suggests that 10% of US employees now regularly work from home. Not the least of which being the fact that it saves time and money for both employee and employer alike.   While some may choose to do their work remotely from home, we at AZ Smart Document Solutions would suggest that if you have any [distractions at home](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-be-more-productive-working-from-home-2012-9?op=1) you consider using some of the free, paid and hybrid resources all located here in the valley. This is especially true if you have an energetic toddler at home (like I do)!
 
##Free Resources
Some businesses around town welcome coworkers with open arms as well as the many great libraries this great state has available. The fun thing about telecommuting is all the places available to try. We recommend you move around and see what works for you. Here is a list of some of the great places you can work with other telecommuters for free.

[HIVE Downtown – Phoenix Burton Barr Library](http://www.phoenixpubliclibrary.org/hive)
[1221 N Central Ave, Phoenix, AZ  ](https://goo.gl/maps/bw8s6)
The HIVE is located on the second floor of the Burton Barr – downtown library. The HIVE has a conference room section, a seminar section and also a private room. The Staff at the HIVE often host and put on many different events and seminars weekly. This is also (like all of the locations in this list) a great place to network especially before or after any of their entrepreneurial events. I’ve had the pleasure of presenting in this space on the Periscope app. 

Eureka Loft – Scottsdale Civic Center Library (http://www.scottsdalelibrary.org/eurekaloft)

The Eureka Loft is the City of Scottsdale’s entrepreneurial center. It is on the same floor as the City of Scottsdale’s Economic Development department. What makes this center a little different is its access to audio video equipment and regular training. I’ve also had the pleasure of presenting here on the same subject (Periscope app). 


Thinkspot MESA – Mesa Library
(http://www.mesathinkspot.org/) 
635 N Power Rd, Mesa, AZ 85205
ThinkSPOT is the Mesa Library system’s entry into the entrepreneurial co-working space. What sets this center apart from its sister centers across the valley is the fact that they are highly focused as both a makerspace and an audio/video production resource. They have all the equipment one would need to do a high level podcast and/or vlog but the resources are available on a first come, first serve basis. I will be presenting on (you guessed it) Periscope at this facility on Thursday, August 20th at 5:30pm. Feel free to stop by if you’d like to learn more about the app or at least meet in person. 

Buckeye – Entrepreneurial Center
(http://growbuckeye.com/543/) 
 21699 W Yuma Rd #116, Buckeye, AZ 85326  The Buckeye Entrepreneurial Center is by far the newest entrepreneurial center here in the valley however, this by no means, downplays the center’s . This facility boasts both a conference room and a larger meeting room. I had the pleasure of attending their grand opening in June and I hope to present at their facility in the near future. 

Goodyear – Innovation Hub
 (http://develop.goodyearaz.com/business-assistance/the-innovationhub-goodyearaz) 
190 North Litchfield Road, Goodyear, AZ 85338

This is likely the second youngest of the library-based entrepreneurial centers around town. This facility – Innovation Hub – is a little smaller than others but includes a large training room, a smaller boardroom with whiteboards and a small office that can be reserved from time to time. I will be presenting on Periscope at this facility on Saturday – August 15th at 2:30pm. 

Gangplank Chandler 
(http://gangplankhq.com/)  260 S Arizona Ave, Chandler, AZ 85225

Gangplank is such a great ide in my opinion. It brings together the cost-effectiveness (i.e., FREE) that one of the library entrepreneurial centers offers while combining the collaborative element that you see at most paid co-working spaces. The basic idea that Gangplank offers is that you can have a space to work, for free but once you’ve seen enough benefit you are expected to give back. 

Gangplank Avondale 
(http://gangplankhq.com/avondale/)
525 N. Central, Avondale, AZ 85323

This is simply the West side outpost for the Gangplank brand. A little less busy than the Chandler location but, I believe hat has everything to do with the fact that those in the west valley aren’t even aware it exists. You are now armed with the knowledge – if you’re in the west valley and want to check out a co-working space you should absolutely drop by Gangplank Avondale. 

So there you have it a list of all of great spaces for telecommuters to check out, work, network and co-work. Not necessarily in that order either. When your home office device stalls on you or if you have unique documents that need to be put together yesterday call us at Arizona Smart Solutions. 

PAID: There are a number of paid facilities in the greater Phoenix metro area that are great oasis’s for the telecommuter. Here are a few I have direct experience with. 

Co-Hoots 
(https://cohoots.com/) 
1027 E Washington St #107, Phoenix, AZ 85034

Co-hoots is a great facility that I (currently) call home for my business. The facility has a built-in coffee shop, desks that are able to adjust from a sitting desk to a standing desk, a conference room lovingly called the “fishbowl”, smaller meeting rooms and also “phone booth” sections for you to make and take phone calls without disturbing your fellow co-workers too much. The pricing is very reasonable in my opinion and I would add since the facilities owners are also the owners of eeko design – a local design firm – the space is very aesthetically pleasing. Not to mention infiltrated by multiple random owls.  
OfficePile 
(http://www.theofficepile.com/)
2501 N 7th St, Phoenix, AZ 85006

Also located downtown is the OfficePile a co-working space that is approximately a year old. This facility – a former bank – is also beautifully designed once you step foot inside you’ll immediately notice the infusion of modern and latin-influenced art. This speaks a little to the community that dwells at this minority owned facility (co-hoots is minority owned as well but whose counting?) – which, according to their website is the “first culturally diverse co-working space in the nation.” This facility has an open desk area, a vault section conference room and upstairs space for training and seminars. It also has a kitchen area for its members. 

MOD 
(http://thatsmod.com/)  2828 N Central Ave #100, Phoenix, AZ 85004  MOD is another downtown facility. One key differentiator here is the space reminds me (at least) of an upscale hotel lobby. The pricing also veers toward the higher end of co-working spaces here in the valley. Another key differentiator about this location is the fact that not only does it have a coffee shop but also a BAR built into the facility! If you need a drink after a long day – then this facility might be best for you as a nightcap is only steps away. 

Seedspot 
(http://www.seedspot.org/)
2828 N Central Ave, 7th floor, Phoenix, AZ 85004
Located in the same building as MOD but on the 7th floor lies Seedspot. Seedspot seems to be more for the entrepreneur or business owner in startup stage rather than someone with a well established business. This is evidenced in part simply by their mission statement which reads “To educate, accelerate, and invest in entrepreneurs who are creating solutions to social problems”. The facility is very open and collaborative in nature and I believe there is a bit of an application process to joining the facility. 

Elevate - (inside Paradise Valley mall)
(http://elevatecoworking.com/) 
4568 E Cactus Road M110,(above the Food Court) Phoenix, AZ 85032

Elevate is something of a hidden gem located in the beautiful Paradise Valley community. Being that it is inside of the mall not many visit this location without the intention of co-working here. If you’re in Paradise Valley or even western Scottsdale for that matter this might be a great place for you to get work done. 

EZ spaces 
(http://www.ezspaces.com/) 
1530 E Williams Field Rd #201 Gilbert, Arizona 85295  EZ Spaces is a location that is “all-inclusive” to its members and includes desks, conference rooms and some occasional snacks from what I understand. If you are in the east Valley and near the Gilbert neighborhood specifically I would encourage you to check out this space.   Deskhub 
(http://www.deskhub.com/)
4900 North Scottsdale Road, Ste 4500,Scottsdale, AZ 85251

I had the pleasure of touring this facility just the other day after realizing it is literally in my backyard. This is one of 5 locations – based here in the valley. This one being in Scottsdale – it is another that is based on the “all-inclusive” model. The pricing seems a little high for the market but the location is amazing if you need to be near Scottsdale and some potentially game-changing companies call the space home. If in Scottsdale, drop in, take a tour and decide for yourself.
