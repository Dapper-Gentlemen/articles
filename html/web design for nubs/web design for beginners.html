“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” - Norman Vincent Peale

The problem with this mentality in marketing is that the stars are so far away you will run out of time, energy and money before ever reaching one. In a world where your audience is distracted with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/schmidt-data/">more content then they ever have been in the history of humanity</a>, you need to figure out exactly who you are trying to reach. This is why the first step in designing your new website is to define who you are designing the website for. You need to define your target audience.

So how do you define your website's target audience? By taking the time to really think about and answer the following six questions you can define your website's target audience which will allow you to construct a solid foundation upon wich your website will be designed and built.

What Problems Are Solved?

You may be providing answers and solutions that your target audience <em>needs</em> or that your customers <em>want</em>, but either way you are solving problems by providing answers and solutions. Make a list of the solutions you provide and ask yourself what problem each of those solutions is solving. If you have customers who have purchased from you reach out to those customers and ask them a series of questions designed to figure out the problems you were solving for them.

Example:
Let's pretend that you make and sell jewlery on etsy. Your #1 selling product is cufflinks. You can check your order history and make a list of names of everyone who purchased this item from you. How would the design of your site be different if the majority of purchases were men? How about if you asked your customers if the item was for themselves or for use as a gift?

Let's assume that you find most of your buyers were women who were purchasing your jewlery for a gift for their husbands. In this example you might try running promotions around holidays known for giving gifts to men, like fathers day. In this example the problem that you are solving is <em>What should I get my husband for Fathers Day?</em> Other problems that arises in this situation are <em>How should I wrap this present?</em> and <em>I need to get a card to go along with this present.</em> These are opportunities for you to make more money as well as additional ways to save your customer's time by solving her problems.
