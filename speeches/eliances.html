Good morning. First I would like to thank Mike LASTNAME and eliances for inviting me here today. Myself and my company build great products, we often forget about networking and meeting interesting new people in real life. So thank you for this opportunity.

Myself and my company, Dapper Gentlemen, have been solving problems for companies with technology solutions since the mid 90s. Back then it was all about Director presentations on compact discs and a few websites for our more advanced customers. For the last 6 years we have been focused on mobile and web apps, having worked with some of the best fortune 500 companies and startups, many of them local. We are a bunch of product guys with interests ranging from the emotional end of user experience design to logical machine learning and artificial intelligence.

So what can my company offer you and your company?
I have an upcoming talk with with the at the Scottsdale Civic Center on September 4th that will explore how mobile apps can help any local business that will be free for you to attend. On a more time sensitive matter, Google will be removing all websites that are not responsive from their Search Engine Results Pages beginning on April 21st. According to some very recent studies, 63% of all local google searches are now done on mobile devices. Another test just conducted by Groupon revealed that 60% of all direct traffic really results from organic search engine results. This means that up to 80% of all of your website traffic comes from Google, Bing and Yahoo, and most of that is happening on mobile.

If your website is not responsive by April 21st, Google will remove your website from its mobile SERPS. You could lose more than half of your website traffic if your website is not mobile friendly by the end of the month.

We <3 local companies, and this is why I was so excited by the chance to speak with everyone here today, and why I am so grateful for Mike and eliances for reaching out to me. We will analyze the website of anyone referred from to us from eliances for free, as well as provide them a basic report on what needs to be fixed to be compliant with Google's changes. You can use that information for your internal team or let us know if you would like us to give you a quote to bring your site up to code. We will also give anyone referred from eliances a 20% discount on our webdesign services.

So how can you help Dapper Gentlemen?
We are always looking at ways to better understand our target audience. We are deeply interested in what your needs as an Arizona business are. We are interested in giving back to the state and the companies that have given us so much. If you have the time head over to dappergentlemen.com/arizona and tell us how you see apps, websites and other digital products solving problems that you and your company experience.

Thank you again for this opportunity, I look forward to getting to know more about some of the great companies I've heard meet at eliances.
