What is Design?
---------------

Design happens when a human being observes or senses a problem, or a gap where the user experience is negatively impacted, and they define the problem, explore alternatives, and make a four-step iterative process to solve that problem.

What are the Four Steps in an Iterative Design Process?
======================================================

Plan
====
*Problem Definition:* What are the problems?
*Exploration:* Research all the ways the problem can be solved. Exploration is fundamentaly divergent to understand the full space of possibilities. As you explore more options you gain more clarity into the problem definitions which will give you more areas to explore.
*Select the Plan:* Converge your ideas to the best solutions.

Great design is iterative from great designers that worked on the same problems before.

Establish expectations for the artifact in a [spec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)), which is also something you will improve upon later.

Question 1.1
What is an artifact that evokes an emotion of love, or enjoyment every time I use it?
Write <100 word explanation of why I love using the artifact.

I purchased a [Saddleback thin leather briefcase](http://i.imgur.com/r8ZWQOj.jpg) a few years ago to carry my design tools around in and it has become an artifact I would find it difficult to live without. The artifact is a well designed utilitarian piece, as well as a subjectively beautiful example of artistic craftsmanship. I love everything about the experience of using it, from the many pockets to store important items, to the heavy and high-quality leather constrution which protects the important artifacts contained within.
