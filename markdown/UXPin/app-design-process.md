#Recognizing the Problem

The first step in the design process is to recognize that there is a problem. This isn't easy and many times the problem you think you recognize isn't the root of the problem at all. If there is a river that needs crossing, for example, the problem isn't that there is a river, but that there is not a way to cross the river. 

If you identify the problem as the existence of the river what are your options to cross it? Maybe you could divert the flow of the river, or damn it up, or some other way to elimnate the river. These are solutions you could design but how efficient would these solutions be to execute upon? 

The solution to the problem of there not being a way to cross the river (instead of the existence of the river) could be to build a boat, or a bridge. By recognizing what the actual problem is we as designers are able to design and build a solution to that problem. So how do you effectively recognize the problem?

First we start with the perceived problem. This is about the UX design process for a mobile app, so we aren't going to use the example of the river. Instead we will use an example of a problem I find myself constantly experiencing that I would like to find a solution for. The problem is *a feeling of too much stress and a desire to reduce that stress*.

**Original Problem Definition:**
*I have too much stress and I would like to reduce that amount.*

The problem of having too much stress and wanting to reduce it is too general to design a solution around. How many different ways can you think of to manage stress? Maybe you take a cigarette break, or listen to music, or maybe you can't even recognize when you are stressed and have no way of dealing with it. How many of these solutions would work for other people in your target audience? It is important to discover the root of the problem, and to do that we can use a simple technique known as the Five Whys Technique.

##The Five Whys Technique

> For Want of a Nail  
> For want of a nail the shoe is lost;  
> For want of a shoe the horse is lost;  
> For want of a horse the rider is lost;  
> For want of a rider the battle is lost;    
> For want of a battle the kingdom is lost;  
> And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.  
> â€” [George Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert)

The [Five Whys Technique](http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf) is an iterative question-asking technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem to help you find the root cause of that problem. To use [this technique](http://www.shmula.com/jeff-bezos-5-why-exercise-root-cause-analysis-cause-and-effect-ishikawa-lean-thinking-six-sigma/987/) we first start with our original problem:

***I have too much stress and I would like to reduce that amount.***

Now it is time to start asking and answering the *whys*.

**Why am I so stressed?**  
*I am so stressed because I have too many stressful thoughts.*
**Why do I have so many stressful thoughts?**
*...because I am unable to remove stressful thoughts.*
**Why am I unable to remove stressful thoughts?**
*...because I am unable to identify stressful thoughts.*
**Why am I unable to identify stressful thoughts?**
*...because I am not aware of how thoughts arise in my mind.*
**Why am I not aware of how my thoughts arise in my mind?**
*...because I do not understand my mind.*


And so, the root cause of my stress is my lack of understanding of my own mind, which is something I can learn about and design a process or solution to fix. They key to understanding the root cause of the problem is in identifying a broken process or an alterable behavior. 

How do I increase my mental focus, reduce my stress, and become a happier person?

Get a better understanding of my mind and how it works.
Research and develop a process to assist in [the motive to realize one's full potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-actualization).
Practice meditation
Discover religion
A financial plan that would afford me to see a psychotherapist.
Learn more about psychology
LSD Induced Shock Therapy
Just LSD no Shock Therapy

A few of these things can be designed into an app.

So how can I get a better understanding of my mind in an effort to increase my mental focus, reduce my stress and become a happier person?


Research a process or theory that has to do with my mind like stress, mental focus and happiness.

##Problem Definition

With the knowledge we now have of our real problem, it is time to redefine the problem definition. Originally it was

Interview people with that experience the same problem that you do.

##The Problem Definition
A single statement that captures the scope of the problem we are trying to solve.
