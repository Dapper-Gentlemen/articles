#The Problem

> The first step in solving a problem is to recognize that it does exist.
> - Zig Ziglar

Design is the process of planning a way to produce an [artifact](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/106473/what-does-artifact-mean) to solve a gap in the [user experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design). The first step in the UX design process is to recognize that there is [a gap](https://vimeo.com/85040589), or problem, for which you can design a solution. That means we need to start with a problem.

Letâ€™s examine an analogy for a minute. A problem I often experience (and imagine many others also experience) is that *I have [too much stress](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/01/stressed-america.aspx)*. I did some quick and dirty research by calling up a dozen friends and asking if it was a problem they felt they also had. Nine out of the 12 people interviewed said they experience the same problem. I suspect three of those 12 people are super-secret Zen monks whose identities have been changed to protect them from the forces of evil the government sometimes hires them to combat. Their base of operations is probably at the bottom of the ocean, or [inside a volcano](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolcanoLair). What is your experience with stress? Help me with research on this project by taking [this 5 minute survey](http://goo.gl/forms/WtjuvsIopY).

Now that we have perceived a problem we can define it in a [problem statement, or definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_statement). A **problem definition** is a *statement that captures the scope of the problem we are trying to solve*.

##Perceiving the Problem

As a designer fortunate enough to get to work with some [incredible teams building mobile apps](http://dappergentlemen.com), I get to hear a lot about what other people think about the way many apps are designed and function. There are so many great examples of well designed apps available, it makes finding inspiration easy and enjoyable. Not every app is a pillar of stellar design though, every now and then I hear about one that got everything wrong.

Recently my wife was trying to find an app to assist her with something... something that I can't remember. I wasn't listening very closely to the beginning of the story. I need to continue to work on my listening skill. Anyway. She was telling me about an app that she was trying to use and said:  

**"This is a bad app"**.

My designers ears pricked up at the sound of a problem.

"What's that dear? You have a problem that needs solving?"

"No, I'm trying to tell you a story. Can't you just empathize with me and let me finish?" she probably implored.

"Of course I'll help you" I exclaimed! "First we need to understand your *perceived problem* at a deeper level."

*An audible sigh came from somewhere in the room.*

Many people don't know how to begin solving their problem because they don't take the time to really consider their problem. This is usually true not because the person is lazy, rather they just don't know how to go about thinking about the problem on a deeper level in an effort to understand what is causing it. The design process has to start somewhere though, and that starting point is usually our perceived problem. The perceived problem my wife was having (apart from my listening and empathizing skills) was that the app she was trying to use was a bad app. What was my original perceived problem?

**I have too much stress.**

Oh yeah. Well, the problem of having too much stress is probably too general to design a solution around. As is the problem of an app being bad. How many ways can you fix a bad app? All the ways probably. How many [different ways can you think of to manage stress](http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/tips-to-control-stress)? Are overall app design and amounts of stress our real problems, or are they symptoms of deeper problems?

###Symptoms
A symptom is a [subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia) departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a user. For example, the feeling (feelings are subjective, not [objective](https://www.lib.odu.edu/genedinfolit/1infobasics/subjective_vs_objective.html)) of being tired (departure from the normal of being awake during the day) is a symptom (a subjective departure from the norm) of not getting enough sleep.

Our feeling of too much stress is a subjective departure from our normal function of not being too stressed. It also has many different ways we could deal with it, such as having a glass of wine at night, or a bottle, or listening to music, or watching TV. Maybe you know someone who has huge [meltdowns](http://giphy.com/gifs/b7nugvA2NwPbW) and [throws tantrums](http://giphy.com/gifs/12BQVyMqxgVNvy) as a way of *letting off steam*. Maybe you sit in a quiet place and breathe deeply and try to figure out what is causing you to feel stressed. Many people don't even recognize that they are stressed, which means it's not easy to recognize what is causing it. 

Is having too much stress really our problem? It seems like it is just a symptom of a much deeper problem. In order to solve the perceived problem of having too much stress, we need to think about the problem to determine if it is a root cause or merely a symptom of something [deeper](http://zoomquilt.org).

###Root Cause
Why is it important to find the [root cause]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause)) of the problem? It's important because solving a symptom isn't a permanent solution. If your [leg hurts](http://giphy.com/gifs/adventure-time-upvote-whatever-PzlRZCKCmTVjq) you could take aspirin to dull the pain, but you will not be fixing the root cause of the pain, and so you will continue to experience the pain which is a symptom of the real problem. If you went to the doctor complaining about the pain and she determined that your leg hurt because you broke a bone, you could address the broken bone, which is the root cause of the pain problem. Be careful not to let your doctor get too abstract in her analysis, you don't want her to determine the root cause of the pain to be your central nervous system. Removing that would probably cause many additional, though interesting, problems.

So how do we determine the root cause of our perceived problem? We can use something developed at Toyota during the design of its manufacturing methodologies known as the [Five Whys Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys).

##The Five Whys Technique

The [Five Whys Technique](http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf) is an iterative question-asking technique we will use to explore the [cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_and_Effect_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)) relationships underlying our perceived problems. This will enable us to find the root cause of our perceived problem. What was my wife confused about again? Something about an app she was trying to use I think.

**This is a bad app. Also you could do a better job at listening to me when I'm trying to tal..**

..oh yeah that's right. She couldn't figure out how to use some app. Good think I'm here, I can totally help out! We will start by asking and answering the **Five Whys**.

**1. Why is it a bad app?**  
*...because it doesn't work the right way. (refined problem)*  
**2. Why doesn't it work the right way?**  
*...because I don't understand where to go. (refined problem)*  
**3. Why don't you understand where to go?**  
*...because none of these icons make sense. (refined problem)*  
**4. Why don't the icons make sense?**
*...because they don't take me where I think they should. (refined problem).*
**5. Why don't they take you where you think they should?**
*...because some of them that I think are icons, actually aren't, and the ones that are icons aren't ones I've ever seen before. (alterable behaviors identified)*

The root cause of the first problem has been identified very quickly, which a designer could use to identify what needs reworking in their UI. How do we know what the root cause is? They key to understanding the root cause of the problem (*it isn't always answered with the 5th why*) is in identifying a broken process or an alterable behavior. 

What about the problem we want to design a mobile app to fix?

**I have too much stress.**  

**1. Why do I have too much stress?**  
*...because I have too many stressful thoughts. (refined problem)*  
**2. Why do I have so many stressful thoughts?**  
*...because I can not calm my thoughts. (refined problem)*  
**3. Why am I unable to calm my thoughts?**  
*...because I don't practice calming my thoughts. (refined problem)*  
**4. Why am I unable to practice calming my thoughts?**  
*...because I don't have a process to calm my thoughts. (broken process identified)*  
**5. Why do I not have a process to calm my thoughts?**  
*...because I'm not [aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness) of myself enough to know I need one. (deeper broken process identified)*  

[Boom](http://media.giphy.com/media/U0GqVamOu9NPa/giphy.gif). The root cause of the perceived problem of having too much stress is not possessing a process to practice calming and focusing our thoughts. In this example, calming my thoughts would lead to less stress, which solves the original problem. We can evolve our problem definition now:

##Redefining the Problem

**New Problem Definition:**
*I want to calm my thoughts in an effort to reduce my [stress]((http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-symptoms/art-20050987)).*

What about the problem of not being more aware of our true [self](http://www.wired.com/2012/05/the-self-illusion-an-interview-with-bruce-hood/)?

On a deeper level, designing a solution to allow us to experience our true would also reduce stress, as well as helping with other ***symptoms*** like [materialism](http://zenhabits.net/a-guide-to-escaping-materialism-and-finding-happiness/), [isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude) and [antisocial issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder), [narcissism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stop-walking-eggshells/201112/interpersonal-exploitation-typical-narcissists) and [lack of empathy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stop-walking-eggshells/201201/lack-empathy-the-most-telling-narcissistic-trait), etc. The process involved in practicing calming thoughts is a step involved in the process of understanding our true selves, so we aren't avoiding the project by going deeper than our first identified process breakdown. It could be an interesting design problem to delve deeper than we need to, and I think it is one that is worth exploring. Many times it is beneficial to attempt to solve a problem that is a little more difficult than one you are [comfortable with](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/comfort-zone), both in terms of growing as a designer and in terms of designing a more interesting solution and product. Throughout the design process we will continue to evolve the problem definition, so if we find we have [gone too deep](http://giphy.com/gifs/loop-infinite-tea-fWZvYFCh4oyl2) we can abstract back up one level. Let's go ahead and redefine our problem definition:

**Newer Problem Definition:**
*I want to become more aware of my true self in an effort to calm my thoughts, reduce my stress, and become a better person.*

This is a problem that is worth working on. A problem that we, as professional and creative designers, have come to after perceiving an original problem, or *symptom*, thinking deeply about that symptom with help from the *Five Whys Technique*, and iterated into the [masterpiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollice_verso#/media/File:Jean-Leon_Gerome_Pollice_Verso.jpg) that it currently is. This problem will continue to evolve throughout the process of designing a mobile app as a solution, as you will see in the next section where we do some research into the target audience and their needs.
