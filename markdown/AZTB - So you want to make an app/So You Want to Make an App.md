#So You Want to Make an App

So you've had an amazing idea to solve a problem that you've found in your industry and you think an app is the best way to do it. Congratulations! Making an app is amazing, fun and exciting and I am going to tell you how to do it. So who am I?

My name is Ryan Allen. I have been professionally designing digital solutions to problems since the mid 90's with some of the most talented and hard-working groups of people around.  INTRO STUFF

Let's walk through a sample project so you can see how we at Dapper Gentlemen design and build apps. This isn't the only process, it is the one we have found works best for us, though like any product or process it is in a constant state of change.

## Validation
The first thing we recommend doing is validating your idea. You probably had your app idea because you've discovered a problem in your own life that you want fixed. You have probably even told a few friends about your idea. Do you think there is a chance that your friends lied about liking your idea?

### Problem Definition
We start by defining the problem that your idea is solving. Meet Dr. Fuzzy, a potential client that has defined a problem he has that he thinks other's in his target audience might also have. Dr. Fuzzy has a hard time making friends outside of his social circle and would like to develop:

***A new type of social networking app that focuses on bringing different types of kittens together.***

Now that the problem is defined let's find out if other people have the same problem by conducting interviews. Interviews typically last one hour and are best if done face-to-face with potential users. Surveys with open-ended questions are also great tools for determining user needs and validating your idea. 

Dr. Fuzzy goes out and finds 10 other kittens to interview. He finds that 70% of those interviewed told him they would be interested in trying to make new friends with other species.


## User Needs
We are now able to go through all of our data and create a list of user needs. This is a way to see every problem our app could potentially solve and will give us a strong foundation to build from. A small app will have around 50 user needs whereas a more complex app, like a social network, could have thunderer of needs. 

The user needs to:

Accounts
	The user creates an account
		The user creates an account with another social network
			The user creates an account with pawbook
      The user creates an account with meowrr
			...
		The user creates an account with their email address
			The user creates a password
      ...
	The user builds profile data into their account
		The user adds a profile photograph
		...

User On-Boarding
	The user browses for others with similar interests for the first time
	The user interacts with other users for the first time
	...

Invite System
	The user is able to invite friends outside the network
	...
...
...



### Redefine the Problem
Next we will go through the list of user needs and redefine our initial problem. After looking through all the data we want to validate our idea again and make changes where they are appropriate. A number of users indicated they might not be comfortable if puppies are on the network. We might need to adjust our problem definition here to:

***A new type of social networking app that focuses on bringing different types of kittens together in a safe and discriminatory way.***


The next stage is to prioritize your list of user needs and decide on the must-have features for your product launch.

## Prioritizing and Planning
As you can see, a list of user needs can get pretty large. The cost to develop this product with a full feature set is going to be very high in terms of time, talent and money. We are going to want to keep costs and risks as low as possible by defining a few of the most important features which we will use as our foundation to build from.

Here is where we set the most important features that users expect and want in line with our visions. Users have a lot of expectations with apps, so we should make sure those expectations are met.

The app needs to be fast
The app needs to have a good UI
The app needs to work on multiple devices
No puppies allowed
...
...

If we only meet the basic needs of the user our app will not stand apart from the competition. We need to make sure a few of our latent features exist to excite the our target users and provide a fun experience they will share and enjoy. 

A basic need is one that users expect. If these needs aren't met the app will provide a poor user experience and the chance for success is greatly diminished.
  If the app is slow no kittens will enjoy using it. 
  If the app is fast no kittens will notice. It is taken for granted
  ...

A latent need is one that delights the target user.
  The app doesn't allow puppies to join.
  The app allows the user to customize the colors of the interface.
  ...
