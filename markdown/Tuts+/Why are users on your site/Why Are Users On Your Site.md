#Why Are Users On Your Site
Users are on your site to experience and engage with your content. Engagement happens when the user is turned on to your brand's ideas which are enhanced by the content that surrounds it.

##To Become Smarter
The first reason users are on your site is to learn. There can be many reasons why a user wants to learn more about the content you are teaching them from the need and desire to perform better at work to the simple joy of learning.

###To Be Better At the Topics They are Interested In
Almost everyone wants to be better, and if your content can facilitate that for your users you have a major advantage over your competition. Creating and providing interesting, new, and informative content is the first step, the second step is designing and displaying that content in a way that is easily accessible and learnable for your users. There are many ways people learn and it is up to you as an amazing designer to provide different ways for your users to learn from your content.

###To stay updated on the latest trends
Part of being smarter is staying updated on the latest industry trends and news. Ideas and trends aren't static, they are in a constant state of change and they evolve with the community. It is important that you provide relative content in a way your users can easily consume it to stay current with those trends.

##To Belong
[We are social creatures](www.google.com) but not all of us do well in social situations. Online communities can give users the ability to try out different identities and personas and get a feeling for who they really are. Online communities can provide one of the basic human needs, the need to belong.
###It helps to define the user's identity
When we are younger we don't yet know who we really are. Many people can go most of their lives without really knowing who they are. Self-actualization is a constant search as our ideas of self are always changing. By being part of a community users can take experiences and advice from members of that community and relate them to their own ideas about self.

##It is Useful
The utilitarian experience of a site can be one of the most powerful for users who are interested in doing things themselves. Many of the users interested in learning new things will find utilitarian content extremely valuable as it can teach them to stay productive and do things correctly.

When your site is useful for your users you will have them coming back again and again to explore and use your content. By designing your site to make it easy to navigate and use for repeat users you will be doing these users a great service.
