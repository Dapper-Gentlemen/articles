#Recognizing the Problem

The first step in the design process is to recognize that there is a problem. This isn't easy and many times the problem you think you recognize isn't the root of the problem at all. If there is a river that needs crossing, for example, the problem isn't that there is a river, but that there is not a way to cross the river. 

If you identify the problem as the existence of the river what are your options to cross it? Maybe you could divert the flow of the river, or damn it up, or some other way to elimnate the river. These are solutions you could design but how efficient would these solutions be to execute upon? 

The solution to the problem of there not being a way to cross the river (instead of the existence of the river) could be to build a boat, or a bridge. By recognizing what the actual problem is we as designers are able to design and build a solution to that problem. So how do you effectively recognize the problem?

First we start with the perceived problem. This is about the UX design process for a mobile app, so we aren't going to use the example of the river. Instead we will use an example of a problem I find myself constantly experiencing, one that I want to solve. It is a problem that [every designer (and other professionals) experiences](https://vimeo.com/85040589), to some degree, whether they are industry veterans or newbies. The problem of not being good enough for the project they are working on.

##What is The Real Problem

Try to think of some ideas on how you would solve the problem of not being the best designer that you can be. I'm guessing you can come up with a dozen solutions to that problem, as it is very broad. There are a so many things I could do to be a better designer:

	- Become better at listening
	- Practice a growth mindset
	- Draw more
	- More education
	- Find a mentor
	- Become a mentor
	- Work on more projects
	- Work on less projects (maybe I'm too stressed)

Are these solutions to the problem of my perception of my design ability, or is there something deeper than me wanting to be better at my job? Fortunately there is a fun method to analyze my perceived problem in an attempt to find the root of it as well as a way to decide on the best problem to try to tackle to solve the real problem. That is the five why methodology.

##The Five Whys and Hows
The five whys is an iterative question-asking technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=the+five+why+methodology&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

Why is broader
How is more focused

This forces the designer to focus on what level of abstraction is most appropriate for solving this problem.

Reasons to be more general:
It opens up more opportunities to explore.
If you are too general you will not have the resources to make a measurable difference for that problem. The key is to make it slightly more general than you are comfortable with, but not so general that you feel you have no way to make a measurable difference.

Interview people with that experience the same problem that you do.

##The Problem Definition
A single statement that captures the scope of the problem we are trying to solve.
