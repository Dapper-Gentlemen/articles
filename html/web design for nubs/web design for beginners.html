<h2>Who is Your Target Audience?

<blockquote>“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.” - Norman Vincent Peale</blockquote>

The problem with this mentality in marketing is that the stars are so far away you will run out of time, energy and money before ever reaching one. In a world where your audience is distracted with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/schmidt-data/">more content then they ever have been in the history of humanity</a>, you need to figure out exactly who you are trying to reach. This is why the first step in designing your new website is to define who you are designing the website for. You need to define your target audience.

So how do you define your website's target audience? By taking the time to really think about and answer the following six questions you can define your website's target audience which will allow you to construct a solid foundation upon wich your website will be designed and built.

<h3>What Problems Are You Solving?</h3>

You may be providing answers and solutions that your target audience <em>needs</em> or that your customers <em>want</em>, but either way you are solving problems. Make a list of the solutions you provide and ask yourself what problem each of those solutions is solving. If you have customers who have purchased from you reach out to those customers and ask them a series of questions designed to figure out the problems you were solving for them.

Example:
Let's pretend that you make and sell jewelry on etsy. What are some problems that you would be solving with your jewelry for your customers?

Look more fashionable.
Gifts for others.
etc

<h3>Who Are the Customers You Are Solving These Problems For?</h3>

You can now make a list of all the potential customers that suffer from the problems you have identified. Once you have this list done ask yourself what are their common demographic, psychographic, and geographic characteristics. Some basic examples are gender, age range, education level and geographic location.
