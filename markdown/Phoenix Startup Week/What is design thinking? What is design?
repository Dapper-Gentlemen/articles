Design is about solving problems.

The first step in solving a problem is to identify the problem you are trying to solve.

So how do you do that?

The 5 Whys Method, or the Toddler Method as I call it. All you have to do to is ask and answer "Why" five times. 

I'd like to use an example that I myself have and I hypothesize will relate to over 33% of the people in the audience. 

In the spirit of lean practices and data-driven decisions I can even run a quick test on my hypothesis. 

Please raise your hand if you feel like you experience too much stress in your life.

Alright, so x% of you have the same problem I do. Let's make sure it's a real problem with the 5 whys method which was developed within the Toyota Motor Corp or as I like to call it the toddler method.

Perceived problem:
I have too much stress.

1. Why do I have too much stress?  
...because I have too many stressful thoughts. (refined problem) 

2. Why do I have too many stressful thoughts?  
...because I can not stop stressful thoughts. (refined problem)  

3. Why am I unable to stop stressful thoughts? 
...because I do not practice stopping stressful thoughts. (refined problem)  

4. Why do I not practice stopping stressful thoughts?  
...because I don't have a process stop stressful thoughts. (broken process identified)  

5. Why do I not have a process to stop stressful thoughts?  
...because I'm not aware of myself enough to know I need one. (deeper broken process identified)

This allows us to solve deeper problems for our users, instead of surface level symptoms.

These two words nicely abstract everything you should know to think like a designer.

You see, design is about solving problems,

and the 1st step in solving a problem is identifying the problem to be solved.

I gave a talk recently to a group of designers and received a question that I've had asked quite a lot of me by other designers.

Good answers, like space and time, are relative and observer-dependent.

So how do I give a good answer, and not just nonsense about whatever crazy thought is running through my mind? 

How do I go about discovering the root of this person's problem in an effort to really help them solve it?

I used the same technique I use when I'm starting any new design project. The 5-Whys method, which was developed with many other lean practices within the Toyota Motor Corporation. 

I also like to refer to this method as the toddler method.

The most popular question I am asked by other designers when I give a talk is:

 "What can I do to transition out of my current design field (graphic design / web design) and into UX or product design?"

1. "Why do you want to transition into another design field?" I ask.

"I don't like doing production work anymore" say most of these designers.

2. "Why don't you like doing your current work?" I ask.

"No one listens to me or respects my opinion and I just feel like a tool my boss uses to make images" reply many.

3. "Why does no one listen to you or respect your opinions?" I ask.

"I don't have experience managing a project or a team" they often say.

4. "Why don't you have experience managing a product or a team?" I ask.



5. "Why"

What is design thinking? What is design?

My current understanding of design is that it's...

The planning of a process to produce an artifact that solves a problem in the user's experience.

Before we can begin planning a process, and before we begin sketching, wireframing, prototyping and testing artifacts, we need to identify what the problem is we want to solve.

What is the perceived problem? Are you sure it is really a deep problem and not just a surface problem, or symptom, of something much deeper? 

What is the difference between a symptom and a real problem?

A symptom is a departure from normal function, or feeling, which is noticed by the user.

A symptom is a departure from normal function, OR FEELING, which is noticed by a user. An example is a website with many small inconsistincies. As an human being our minds are built to recognize patterns. It is fundamental in how we organize and understand reality. So as a human being using a website, you will very quickly and very deeply feel when a piece of user interface has pattern inconsistencies, even small ones.

Here is an example of amazon.com. The exxample on the left is a screenshot. The example on the right is a screenshot with small inconsistencies in its UI Patterns. Things like multiple font across the same heading levels. 22px H2 here, 20px H2 here, etc.

When I show this to people I often hear 'whats different with this left one, something isnt right.' At a deep level the version on the right makes users feel 'uncomfortable', or as my toddler would say, 'yucky'.



Example of amazon.com next to amazon.com shifted aroud a bit.
