#Recognizing the Problem

> The first step in solving a problem is to recognize that it does exist.
> - Zig Ziglar

The first step in the design process is to recognize that there is a problem for which you can design a solution for. Design is the process of planning a way to produce an artifact to solve a problem with the user experience. A problem I often experience is that *I have too much stress*. I did some fast and dirty research by calling up a dozen friends and asking if it was a problem they felt they also had, and nine of the twelve people said they experience the same problem. I suspect the other three people are secretly zen monks whose identities have been changed to protect them from the forces of evil. Is this a problem you think you have? Let me know in [this simple yes / no survey](CREATE A SURVEY DERP DE DERP).

Now that we have recognized a problem we can define it in a problem definition. A **problem definition** is a *statement that captures the scope of the problem we are trying to solve*.

##Original Problem Definition
**I have too much stress.**

The problem of having too much stress and wanting to reduce it is probably too general to design a solution around. How many different ways can you think of to manage stress? Maybe you have a glass of wine at night, or a bottle, or listen to music, or maybe you throw huge tantrums, or maybe you can't even recognize when you are stressed and have no way of dealing with it. 

###Symptom or Problem
How many of these solutions would work for other people? Is having too much stress really the problem, or is it just a symptom of a much deeper problem. In order to solve the perceived problem of having too much stress, we need to think about the problem to determine if it is a [root cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause) or merely a symptom of something deeper.

Why is it important to find the root of the problem? It's important because solving a symptom isn't a permanent solution. If your leg hurts you could take painkillers to dull the pain, but you will not be fixing the root of the pain, and so you will continue to experience the pain which is a symptom of the real problem. If you went to the doctor complaining about the pain and she determined that your leg hurt because you broke a bone, you could address the broken bone, which is the root of the pain problem.

So how do we determine the root of our perceived problem? We can use something developed at Toyota during the design of its manufacturing methodologies known as the [Five Whys Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys).

##The Five Whys Technique

> For Want of a Nail  
> For want of a nail the shoe is lost;  
> For want of a shoe the horse is lost;  
> For want of a horse the rider is lost;  
> For want of a rider the battle is lost;    
> For want of a battle the kingdom is lost;  
> And all for the want of a horseshoe nail.  
> â€” [George Herbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Herbert)

The [Five Whys Technique](http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf) is an iterative question-asking technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem to help you find the root cause of that problem. To use [the Five Whys Technique](http://www.shmula.com/jeff-bezos-5-why-exercise-root-cause-analysis-cause-and-effect-ishikawa-lean-thinking-six-sigma/987/) to determine the root of our problem we first start with our original perceived problem:

**I have too much stress.**

Now it is time to start asking and answering the *whys*.

**1. Why do I have too much stress?**  
*...because I have too many stressful thoughts.*
**2. Why do I have so many stressful thoughts?**
*...because I can not calm my thoughts.*
**3. Why am I unable to calm my thoughts?**
*...because I don't practice calming my thoughts.*
**4. Why am I unable to practice calming my thoughts?**
*...because I don't have a process to calm my thoughts.*
**5. Why do I not have a process to calm my thoughts?**
*...because I'm not aware of myself enough to know I need one.*

And so, the root cause of my perceived problem of having too much stress is that I don't have a process to practice calming and focusing my thoughts. How do we know that is the root cause of my stress? They key to understanding the root cause of the problem (it isn't always answered with the 5th why) is in identifying a broken process or an alterable behavior. In this example, calming my thoughts would lead to less stress, which solves the original problem. We can evolve our problem definition now:

**New Problem Definition:**
*I want to calm my thoughts in an effort to reduce my [stress]((http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-symptoms/art-20050987)).*

What about the problem of not being more aware of my true self?

On a deeper level, designing a solution to facilitate in experiencing your true self would also reduce stress, as well as helping with other symptoms like [materialism](http://zenhabits.net/a-guide-to-escaping-materialism-and-finding-happiness/), isolation and social issues, lack of empathy, etc. The process involved in practicing calming thoughts is most likely a step involved in the process of understanding the nature of self. It could be an interesting design problem to go deeper than we need to go, and I think it is one that is worth exploring. Throughout the design process we will continue to evolve the problem definition. Let's do that again before we start exploring.

**Newer Problem Definition:**
*I want to become more aware of my true self in an effort to calm my thoughts, reduce my stress, and become a better person.*

Now that we know what problem we want to solve it is time to start doing some research.
