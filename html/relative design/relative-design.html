Relative Web Design

Designing websites and webapps is more exciting now than it ever has been. With so many ways a user can experience our craft it puts a lot of responsibility on us and our teams to truly build something amazing. So how do you start designing something amazing? 
How indeed.

Examples:

Print publications are relative to commuters on mass transportation (subways and planes) who don't have access to reliable internet.

A website with a black text on a bright white screen is great during the day, but what if the user is reading the site at night in a dark room?

If a user is accessing a company website on a mobile device what sorts of things become more important to their needs? If you have a physical local location could the user be trying to find your location and hours of opperation? Your phone number?

If a user is on a mobile device would it be easier for them to engage with your content if it were available in an audio format?
