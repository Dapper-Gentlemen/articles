One of the best things about working at Dapper Gentlemen is having the opportunity to work with some of the smartest people disrupting some of the best industries. We recently had the pleasure of working with [Jonathan Keyser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathankeyser) and his incredibly talented team at [Keyser](http://www.keyserco.com) on their [Office Space Calculator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keyser-office-space-calculator/id931228445?mt=8) for iOS. I wanted to speak with Jonathan about his vision for Keyser and how mobile plays into that vision.

**Thanks for taking the time out of your schedule to speak with me today Jonathan. While we were working together you were passionate about communicating your commitment to "selfless service". Can you elaborate a bit on what "selfless service" means?**

Definitely! Selfless service is about serving others regardless of personal gain, and creating lasting relationships with those that we serve. It is about helping someone without thought of reciprocation, and putting everything you have into that single act of service. The mission of Keyser is to prove definitively, once and for all, that selfless service is the most *self interested* strategy ever, and we believe that selflessly serving others will result in a more successful and fulfilling career and life overall. 

**That's fantastic. Can you tell me how tech, such as mobile apps, enables selfless service at Keyser?**

Our 14th Core Operating principle is that we are disruptive, we embrace change and we constantly explore and integrate new tools and technologies with the goal of maximizing personal efficiency and delivering best in class service to each and every client. As a result, technology is a huge part of selfless service for us at Keyser. Not only is it crucial to spreading our message, whether that be through [social media](https://twitter.com/keyserco), our [website](http://www.keyserco.com), [blog](http://www.keyserco.com/github-headquarters-an-office-space-calculation/), etc., but it also allows us to constantly create and foster relationships. These relationships are critical to our selfless service model, and we leverage technology to keep creating touch points that foster and grow those relationships. 

**How has embracing technology helped keyser to focus on users?**

We believe in making our clients' real estate search as seamless and smooth as possible, which is why we launched the 1st of its kind, *free* commercial real estate [Keyser Office Space Calculator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keyser-office-space-calculator/id931228445?mt=8) iOS app to help office tenants quickly estimate how much potential office space they need.

"We have been looking across the commercial real estate landscape for years trying to find a better solution than the status quo" stated *Noah Barrasso*, head of Keyser's Emerging Technologies Practice Group.  "After not liking any of the options we identified, we finally decided to create this app to fill this void and help companies across the globe with their real estate planning."
 
The app won't replace architects or space planners who are still essential for the space design process, but in *five to seven minutes*, it provides a quick calculation for how much square footage is needed and can help negate wasted time, energy, and resources used to look at properties that are simply inadequate for the company's requirements.

**How important is your mobile strategy for the future?**

Our mobile strategy is extremely important going forward. People are more attached to their phones now than ever, and we intend to capitalize on that by bringing more of what they need in the real estate process, right to their fingertips. This first [office space calculator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keyser-office-space-calculator/id931228445?mt=8) is the first of a series of end user focused real estate apps being developed currently by Keyser. 
 
**What other ideas do you have for mobile in the future. What can your users expect?**
 
The [Keyser Office Space Calculator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keyser-office-space-calculator/id931228445?mt=8) is the first in a series of apps we are creating to help various space users identify their estimated square footage requirements.  Additional apps being developed currently include apps for Retail, Medical, Educational, Biotech, Industrial, etc., and we are continuously exploring where there may be a gaps in the process, or a step that may be improved upon, and putting our minds to work to come up with something that will truly benefit our clients in their real estate searches. Stay tuned...
