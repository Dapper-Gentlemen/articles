#The Problem

> The first step in solving a problem is to recognize that it does exist.
> - Zig Ziglar

Design is the process of planning a way to produce an [artifact](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/106473/what-does-artifact-mean) to solve a gap in the [user experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design). The first step in the UX design process is to recognize that there is [a gap](https://vimeo.com/85040589), or problem, for which you can design a solution. That means we need to start with a problem. A problem I often experience (and imagine many others also experience) is that *I have [too much stress](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/01/stressed-america.aspx)*. I did some quick and dirty research by calling up a dozen friends and asking if it was a problem they felt they also had. Nine out of the 12 people interviewed said they experience the same problem. I suspect three of those 12 people are super-secret Zen monks whose identities have been changed to protect them from the forces of evil the government sometimes hires them to combat. Their base of operations is probably at the bottom of the ocean, or [inside a volcano](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolcanoLair). What is your experience with stress? Help me with research on this project by taking [this 5 minute survey](http://goo.gl/forms/WtjuvsIopY).

Now that we have perceived a problem we can define it in a [problem statement, or definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_statement). A **problem definition** is a *statement that captures the scope of the problem we are trying to solve*.

##Perceiving the Problem

[My partners](http://dappergentlemen.com) and [I](http://twitter.com/ryanallen_com) have some of the best jobs. We get to design and build mobile apps, web apps and websites for ourselves as well as our amazing clients. Over the years we have seen trends and patterns emerge in what different clients are looking for. Recently, many small businesses that need a website contact us asking if we can solve their problem, which is that their current website isn't a Wordpress site. After we ask them a few questions we usually identify that the real problem is not that their current website isn't a Wordpress site, but that it isn't easy to update, or that it doesn't appear in any search engine result pages (SERPS), or that it isn't responsive to all the different screen sizes that exist today, or all of these things. The root cause of these problems is that the website isn't bringing in the right users who convert to sales. By finding the root of the perceived problem they are experiencing we are able to design solutions that will meet and exceed their expectations.  

The solution to the problem statement "I don't have a Wordpress site" is simple. You build a Wordpress site. That problem will be solved but new problems will arise. "I don't have a fast loading Wordpress site" for example. 

Many people don't know how to begin solving their problem because they don't take the time to really consider their problem. This is usually true not because the person is lazy, rather they just don't know how to go about thinking about the problem on a deeper abstract level in an effort to understand what is causing it. The design process has to start somewhere though, and that starting point is usually our perceived problem. For many of the small businesses we work with their perceived problem is not having a Wordpress site. What was our perceived problem again?

**I have too much stress.**

Oh yeah. Well, the problem of having too much stress is probably too general to design a solution around, just like the problem of not having a Wordpress site. How many [different ways can you think of to manage stress](http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/tips-to-control-stress)? Is stress really the problem or is it just a symptom of something deeper?

###Symptoms
A symptom is a [subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia) departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a user, reflecting the presence of an unusual state or problem, which can not be measured directly. 

Our feeling of too much stress is a subjective departure from normal function or feeling. It also has many different ways we could deal with it, such as having a glass of wine at night, or a bottle, or listening to music, or watching TV. Maybe you know someone who has huge [meltdowns](http://giphy.com/gifs/b7nugvA2NwPbW) and [throws tantrums](http://giphy.com/gifs/12BQVyMqxgVNvy) as a way of *letting off steam*. Maybe you sit in a quiet place and breathe deeply and try to figure out what is causing you to feel stressed. Many people don't even recognize that they are stressed, which means it's not easy to recognize what is causing it. Is having too much stress really our problem? It seems like it is just a symptom of a much deeper problem. In order to solve the perceived problem of having too much stress, we need to think about the problem to determine if it is a root cause or merely a symptom of something [deeper](http://zoomquilt.org).

###Root Cause
Why is it important to find the [root cause]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause)) of the problem? It's important because solving a symptom isn't a permanent solution. If your [leg hurts](http://giphy.com/gifs/adventure-time-upvote-whatever-PzlRZCKCmTVjq) you could take aspirin to dull the pain, but you will not be fixing the root cause of the pain, and so you will continue to experience the pain which is a symptom of the real problem. If you went to the doctor complaining about the pain and she determined that your leg hurt because you broke a bone, you could address the broken bone, which is the root cause of the pain problem. Be careful not to let your doctor get too abstract in her analysis, you don't want her to determine the root cause of the pain to be your central nervous system. Removing that would probably cause many additional, though interesting, problems.

So how do we determine the root cause of our perceived problem? We can use something developed at Toyota during the design of its manufacturing methodologies known as the [Five Whys Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys).

##The Five Whys Technique

The [Five Whys Technique](http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf) is an iterative question-asking technique we will use to explore the [cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_and_Effect_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)) relationships underlying our perceived problem. This will enable us to find the root cause of our perceived problem. What about the perceived problem of our small business owner:

**I need a Wordpress site.**

Now it is time to start asking and answering the *whys*.

**1. Why do I need a Wordpress site?**  
*...because I need to have a better website. (refined problem)*  
**2. Why do I need a better website?**  
*...because my current site isn't good. (refined problem)*  
**3. Why isn't my current site good?**  
*...because it doesn't have many visitors. (refined problem)*  
**4. Why doesn't my current site have many visitors?**  
*...because my site doesn't rank on Google. (refined problem)*  
**5. Why doesn't my current site rank on Google?**  
*...because I don't know what steps to take to get it to rank on Google. (broken process identified)*  

The root cause of our problem has been identified very quickly which we can design a solution for. How do we know what the root cause is? They key to understanding the root cause of the problem (*it isn't always answered with the 5th why*) is in identifying a broken process or an alterable behavior. 

In this example our original problem is no longer even relevant. Some of the solutions for better Google rankings are things like [mobile friendly sites](http://dappergentlemen.com/articles/2015/4/2/google-will-penalize-non-mobile-friendly-sites), solid [content strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_strategy), and an understanding of who are [target audience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_audience) really is. The platform that hosts these solutions is ultimately irrelevant.

What about the problem we want to design a mobile app to fix?

**I have too much stress.**

**1. Why do I have too much stress?**  
*...because I have too many stressful thoughts. (refined problem)*
**2. Why do I have so many stressful thoughts?**
*...because I can not calm my thoughts. (refined problem)*
**3. Why am I unable to calm my thoughts?**
*...because I don't practice calming my thoughts. (refined problem)*
**4. Why am I unable to practice calming my thoughts?**
*...because I don't have a process to calm my thoughts. (broken process identified)*
**5. Why do I not have a process to calm my thoughts?**
*...because I'm not [aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness) of myself enough to know I need one. (refined problem)*

[Boom](http://media.giphy.com/media/U0GqVamOu9NPa/giphy.gif). The root cause of the perceived problem of having too much stress is not possessing a process to practice calming and focusing our thoughts. In this example, calming my thoughts would lead to less stress, which solves the original problem. We can evolve our problem definition now:

##Redefining the Problem

**New Problem Definition:**
*I want to calm my thoughts in an effort to reduce my [stress]((http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-symptoms/art-20050987)).*

What about the problem of not being more aware of our true [self](http://www.wired.com/2012/05/the-self-illusion-an-interview-with-bruce-hood/)?

On a deeper level, designing a solution to allow us to experience our true would also reduce stress, as well as helping with other ***symptoms*** like [materialism](http://zenhabits.net/a-guide-to-escaping-materialism-and-finding-happiness/), [isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude) and [antisocial issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder), [narcissism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stop-walking-eggshells/201112/interpersonal-exploitation-typical-narcissists) and [lack of empathy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stop-walking-eggshells/201201/lack-empathy-the-most-telling-narcissistic-trait), etc. The process involved in practicing calming thoughts is a step involved in the process of understanding our true selves, so we aren't avoiding the project by going deeper than our first identified process breakdown. It could be an interesting design problem to delve deeper than we need to, and I think it is one that is worth exploring. Many times it is beneficial to attempt to solve a problem that is a little more difficult than one you are [comfortable with](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/comfort-zone), both in terms of growing as a designer and in terms of designing a more interesting solution and product. Throughout the design process we will continue to evolve the problem definition, so if we find we have [gone too deep](http://giphy.com/gifs/loop-infinite-tea-fWZvYFCh4oyl2) we can abstract back up one level. Let's go ahead and redefine our problem definition:

**Newer Problem Definition:**
*I want to become more aware of my true self in an effort to calm my thoughts, reduce my stress, and become a better person.*

This is a problem that is worth working on. A problem that we, as professional and creative designers, have come to after perceiving an original problem, or *symptom*, thinking deeply about that symptom with help from the *Five Whys Technique*, and iterated into the [masterpiece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollice_verso#/media/File:Jean-Leon_Gerome_Pollice_Verso.jpg) that it currently is. This problem will continue to evolve throughout the process of designing a mobile app as a solution, as you will see in the next section where we do some research into the target audience and their needs.
