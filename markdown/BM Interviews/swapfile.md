Whats an example of an interesting unsolved problem people have been working on?
Also, why are our brains fooled by camoflauge?

"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet"

What we can see is not only limited based on our hardware but on our understanding of the world ( our expectations).

I enjoy reading about things like [AI-complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI-complete), and [Computer vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision).

Imagine someone blind from birth, all of a sudden being able to see. They would essentially be like a baby seeing for the first time, and would have to learn what this new input meant.  They would have to build all of the associations we built, like if a baseball is getting bigger its about to hit them.


[Image segmentation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_segmentation) is a simple one.

We can really easilly tell which pixels in an image are people and which are not, but we have to use green/blue/black screens to help computers tell backgroound from foreground.

We [humans] know based on more than the signal.

We know what a person looks like and the diff ways a person can be posed.

My current favorite is[AI effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect).
