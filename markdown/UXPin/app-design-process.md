#Know Thy User

> “When people talk, listen completely. Most people never listen.” 
― Ernest Hemingway

As you may have read in the last section, the first step in our UX design process was to define the problem in an effort to better understand the core of what we are trying to solve. We want to design a deep and meaningful experience for our potential users as opposed to a shallow simple feature. The second step in our process is defining [who the users are](http://www.usabilityfirst.com/glossary/know-thy-user/), and what they need to solve the problem.

In order to discover the identity of our ideal users who experience the problem we aim to solve we will be collecting raw data from several sources. If you are working on a product that already exists and you already know who your users are, you may be able collect raw data in the form of [digital analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6080732?hl=en), [crash reports](https://try.crashlytics.com), [bounce rates](http://www.analytics-ninja.com/blog/2012/06/google-analytics-bounce-rate-demystified.html), [a/b tests](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1745147?hl=en), [observing users](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2014/01/participatory-observation.php), [conducting interviews](https://lookback.io/learn/user-experience-research/in-person-research), [surveys](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/useful-survey-questions-for-user-feedback-surveys), [focus groups](https://assessment.trinity.duke.edu/documents/How_to_Conduct_a_Focus_Group.pdf), [competitor analysis](http://danforth.co/pages/2014/03/01/conducting-a-solid-ux-competitive-analysis/), [diary studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_studies), [social media mining](http://dmml.asu.edu/smm/book/), [competitive content audits](https://www.content-insight.com/resources/content-inventory-and-audit-articles/competitive-content-audit/), and other [usability studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing). If, like in our case, this is a new app without an existing userbase, it is best to first gain some insight into who our potential target users actually are.

##Known Knowns
Just what do we already know about our users? We know that we are looking for users who have accepted they have a problem with stress, as this is the first step in the user's journey, followed by researching solutions, trying multiple solutions, and ultimately committing to a solution.

We also know that our ideal user for this [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) will be an english speaker (since that is the only language I currently know), have access to the internet (unless we want to [distribute the app via CD's](https://www.quora.com/How-much-did-it-cost-AOL-to-distribute-all-those-CDs-back-in-the-1990s) circa 1992), and contains a basic knowledge of modern web and mobile apps. 

Armed with this basic user knowledge we will find existing solutions, potential users, and subject matter experts in the space. Next we will collect raw data by interviewing and observing our SME's and potential users, as well as auditing our competitors' products. And finally we will analyze our raw data to code a needs statement so that we can design solutions to meet and [exceed](http://imgur.com/J1Cfnd4) those needs.

##Observing and Interviewing Users in Their Environment
I find a good place to start is the one that seems like the most difficult. For me that is getting out of the office and finding some real people to [observe](http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/upload/Horsky-Ethnographic-Methods.pdf) and [interview](http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/contextual-interview.html). For this we must go to their environment, look for cues for the needs like awkward actions, situations where users made fixes for themselves, with tape or glue for example. Also look for hand written signs, like sticky notes, as another great way to observe frustrations.

###Did You Try Googling It?
So what does this process look like in our example? It began with a [google search](http://imgur.com/eln7gQr) asking how to solve our defined problem that resulted in over 4.5 million results. Among the top results was [this article by the Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858) that sums up most of the answers Google provided me with. An answer of meditation.

###Adventures in Meatspace
Next I searched yelp for some local meditation meetups and reached out to a few meditation practitioners who agreed to let me observe their practice. It was simple to find a public meditation group on Yelp, less easy to get them to allow me to record it with a GoPro and impossible to get permission to show it publicly, which is understandable as it can be a pretty private experience as I soon found out.

###Observe
One of the first things I noticed when I attended my first group meetup was a sign on the door of the space they were using (a local church) that said "it is highly recommended that you bring a pillow" -Get photo!

###Ask Questions
I asked the group what the purpose was of the sign and was told "sitting on the floor for longer than 10 minutes hurts without one." There we have already identified a number of potential problems with their process. Those being a rigidity in a physical pose that users may find uncomfortable, length of time spent in the required pose may be too long for some users but too short for others, etc. When I asked if sitting on the floor in a rigid pose for 45 minutes was a requirement I was told "Nothing is required other than trying your best", which allows us more openness to explore what the idea of this process could be like for our users. An example idea is a dynamic audio process that is responsive to the user's time and location.

This observational method is easiest if you are addressing an existing problem for which there are existing solutions offered by competitors. Observe how your competition engages users and see where you can be better. Document with videos as much as you're able, as well as with photos and written notes.

##Competitor Research and Analysis
>"So it is said that if you know your enemies and know yourself, you can win a hundred battles without a single loss." - The Art of War by Sun Tzu

Competitor research and analysis is used to define who our competitors are, understand the solutions they provide, identify valid solutions to our problems and potential problems that arise from their solutions, understand the [level of competition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AD-M5GqalM) and what [strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis) exist in our industry, and further refine our ideal target users in an effort to understand their needs.

Depending on the project's roadmap and your timelines it can be enlightening to branch out and research competitors and solutions in some more general categories. For example, instead of only researching the category of *meditation apps*, which is an obvious space to start on our current path, I also spent hundreds of hours researching and analyzing processes, causes and solutions to our problem in [human behavioral biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D), [cognitive behavioral therapy](http://www.audible.com/pd/Science-Technology/Cognitive-Behavioral-Therapy-Audiobook/B00ZB7Q1RS/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1446670359&sr=1-1), [psychotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurosis_and_Human_Growth) and the [Art of Listening](http://www.amazon.com/The-Art-Listening-Dominick-Barbara/dp/1438291825), a couple [western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism) and [eastern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) religions, theories of [learning](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00461520.2014.965823) and [audience engagement](http://wolfbrown.com/images/books_reports/documents/Making_Sense_of_Audience_Engagement.pdf) as well as a dozen [self-help books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People), [audio guides](https://www.monroeinstitute.org), different yoga instructors, [group meditation events](http://www.yelp.com/), and even [research on synthetic emotions](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nFbuerzcJcYC&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=Emotions:+a+Philosophical+Introduction+By+Jordi+Vallverdú&ots=JDpcRSaB9s&sig=ELMKbld51GTZdJPJgsBCaRwhMKs#v=onepage&q&f=false).

##Interviewing Experts
> Speak, so that I may see you - Socrates

[Subject Matter Expert (SME) interviews](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/8-tips-for-conducting-ux-interviews) take place early on in a new product and are designed to help you gather a general understanding of your [product / market fit](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-define-Product-Market-Fit). If this were an existing product you might start with stakeholder interviews which help when gathering information about the organization, discovering staff needs, and uncovering the major problems as seen by the point of view of the stakeholders.

For this project I identified some Subject Matter Experts and conducted video interviews over skype. I analyzed the recordings and collected data from the interviews in an attempt to identify a common process for relieving stress, and become more aware of yourself, that could be extracted and used as a way to solve our current problem definition.

Problem Definition Restated:
*To enable users to become more aware of themselves in an effort to reduce their stress.*

Some of the common ideas I found in the interviews I conducted had a common solution. The solution had many names from mindfulness to prayer, but I found that there were commonalities between them which you are free to discover yourself in a sampling of interviews I did with a psychologist, neurogenic yoga creator and instructor, a psychic, a polymath and a religious expert. 

Now that we have discovered this common thread it is time to find out what the users are like in a community centered around the idea. Where do we find those communities? Where indeed. 

###Surveys with Potential Users
We are slowly discovering who a potential base of users are for our app. We are looking for people who are interested in making internal changes to themselves by making their mind more flexible in a gradual, consistent, and scientific way.

I was able to find a few places with people who fit into this framework by searching for meditation groups on meetup, and attending different groups with different teachings, as previously stated. I also found a vibrant and active community at r/meditation, r/mindfulness, and many other great communities found in the sidebars of those two subreddits. This second set of communities is where I conducted a few surveys to answer some questions I had on the process of meditation.

Some ideas of the open-ended questions I used in my [Google Survey (which you can see here)](https://docs.google.com/a/dappergentlemen.com/spreadsheets/d/1hZ45IGdXA_4tlDz28T2l5XNe1fmfDAZgpuh9hBndXyU/edit?usp=sharing) were based on:

* How do you do x?
* Why did you choose x?
* What do you like about x?
* What don't you like about x?
* What do you consider when choosing an x?
* What are suggestions for improving x?

When you are interviewing and needfinding with surveys here are a few things to keep in mind:

1. Avoid asking yes/no questions. The reason is you want as much honest information as possible, and limiting them to either yes or no doesn't let the user's mind wander and produce valuable new ideas as opposed. By asking a yes/no question you are validating an idea you had. This phase is about discovering, not validating.

2. Don't ask a survey participant how they would fix something specific, as that is like asking them to be the designer. For example, when trying to research a competitor's app, ask the survey participants (who have been identified as users of the app, of course) to give you their ideas about the app, as this will usually get them to list some problems they have with it as well as things they like about it.

3. Avoid evaluations based on a scale, instead ask for a comparison. Instead of asking if a feature is better or worse than another feature, ask the user about how they feel the two features are different and how they are similar.

For surveys I enjoy using Google Forms. You can create branches in your surveys which allows you to avoid wasting the participants time and increases the chances of getting more valuable answers. For example, in [the previous Google Survey](https://docs.google.com/a/dappergentlemen.com/spreadsheets/d/1hZ45IGdXA_4tlDz28T2l5XNe1fmfDAZgpuh9hBndXyU/edit?usp=sharing), I was able to collect data from over 100 participants who were given the option to provide me with extra demographic and psychographic information at the end if they chose to, which further helps to identify our core target audience. 


4. Identify Users Demo and Psychographics

##Identifying Needs
Time to gather our mountain of notes, videos, and audio recordings in an attempt to analyze all the data and code up some fancy needs statements.

We collected data in an effort to figure out what qualities of our app will close the gap in the user experience. 

###Coding a Needs Statement
We do this by following XXX rules.

1. Needs Statements Should be as Specific as the Raw Data to Avoid Losing Valuable Data.

Here is a need I noted during a user interview of a competitor's product:

	**Original Statement** - "I wish I could adjust the volume better because when voice and music play at the same time the music is so loud I can't hear the person talking."

	**YES** - the app plays background and voice audio at appropriate levels.

	**NO** - the app doesn't have loud background audio.

2. Express Needs Without Implying a Design Concept. 

This allows you to stay focused on the definition of the problem, rather than trying to solve the problem. We want to state a *what*, not a *how* in the needs statements. Again we can use the same example as above:

	**YES** - the app plays background and voice audio at appropriate levels.

	**NO** - the app has separate volume controls for background audio and voice.

3. Express needs as an *attribute of the app* to be designed.

This makes it easier to interpret and edit statements later on as they will all be expressed in a similar way. It also sets users' needs as qualities of the app that if addressed will solve a problem in the user experience.

	**Yes** - The app reminds me to use it.

	**No** - I am reminded to use the app.


4. Avoid the words *must* and *should*.

It is very tempting to use words like must and should, especially if our users used these words, however we should avoid these words to keep from prematurely establishing relative importance. We will determine which needs are more important than the others in a future step.

	**Yes** - The app has no spiritual or religous connotations.

	**No** - The app should not have a spiritual or religious bias.
	**No** - The app must not have a spiritual or religious bias.

With these ideas in mind code a big list of statements. You will potentially have between 25 and 500. Expect this to take some time. I find that it takes me about 2 hours to get through every hour of video, and it is difficult to power through interview videos as they take a lot of cognitive processing to analyze facial and body language as well as spoken language.

Strategy and Research
A successful UX strategy requires buy-in from multiple roles and levels of the organization. Thinking about UX strategically for this project will include discovering: (http://www.redpillux.com/services/ux-strategy-research/)

* what problems we aim to solve, which we have already done.
* who are target users
*
*


Reconciling and prioritizing business and user goals
Understanding target audience(s)
Setting goals and success metrics
Defining an iterative research & design process
Stakeholder education
Planning for organizational change

Now might be a good time to analyze and potentially restate our problem definition.

#Strategy and Research

> When you’re developing a business idea it can be tempting to build the product as quickly as possible in order to launch it early. Often, this is a fatal mistake because it can result in building a solution to your problem rather than something the users will value.

> Although market research might seem like a boring and daunting task, it is still a vital component of any software development project. - http://www.sitepoint.com/conducting-user-interviews-will-actually-help/

You don't have to use a particular user research method at the time of release. You use the one that best meets the needs of your team. With that said here is a giant list of tools for your toolkit.

##Phase 1: Discovery

The discovery phase is the pre-product process in which we, as the designers, through different UX strategies, can obtain data in support of our [problem definition](LINK TO ARTICLE) for organization and analysis.

---

###Subject Matter Expert Interviews

Subject Matter Expert interviews (or stakeholder interviews for an existing product) take place early on in a new product and are designed to help you gather a general understanding of the market space. organization, discover staff needs, and uncover the major problems as seen by the point of view of the stakeholders. Conduct one-on-one interviews with different levels of staff, focusing on actual ‘doers’ as well as managers. These are useful if you are working on an app that already exists, like if you are a new UX designer at an organization.

Subject matter expert interviews take place at the same time and are especially useful for an app that doesn't yet exist, like the app we are working on for example.

Presencing Institute has an excellent [process example](https://www.presencing.com/tools/stakeholder-interviews) and UX Apprentice has a [great list](http://www.uxapprentice.com/resources/stakeholder-interview-template/) of some possible things you may want to identify. These things will differ based on where your product is in its cycle, how large the organization is, though this list is pretty standard across all types of apps:

* The project vision
* Types of users
* Target Audience 
* Value Proposition
* Competition
* Process & Workflow
* Context of Use
* User Experience Goals

EXAMPLES EXAMPLES EXAMPLES
Interview with psychologist PHD. Interview with target users who said they don't have a problem with stress. BM and JH
EXAMPLES EXAMPLES EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES EXAMPLES EXAMPLES

###Affinity Diagraming

An affinity diagram is a simple tool we can use to group ideas and data from our stakeholder interviews. The process works well when done with a cross-functional team including the stakeholders you interviewed and consists of:

1. Recording each idea on a card
2. Looking for ideas that are related
3. Sorting cards into related groups

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_diagram
EXAMPLES EXAMPLES EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES EXAMPLES EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES EXAMPLES EXAMPLES
EXAMPLES EXAMPLES EXAMPLES

Once completed, the affinity diagram may be used to create a cause and effect diagram.

###Cause-and-Effect-Diagram
A cause-and-effect-diagram, also known as a [Ishikawa diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawa_diagram), fishbone diagram (because a finished diagram looks like the skeleton of a fish), or Fishikawa, is a [causual diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model) used to identify possible causes of the [problem your app is trying to solve](link to last article). It is a way to further refine your problem definition.

Mind tools has a great process: https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_03.htm

###Competitor Analysis

A Competitor analysis lets you discover and understand the strenghts and weaknesses of your competitors, allowing you to use the information you gleam for design as well as marketing purposes. Hopefully you got a list of the main competitors from your stakeholder interviews, but if not fear not. You can Google a list of keywords for your product and see who ranks highest. Try to find the top 5 competitors and discover things like:

* Potential target users
* UI design rationale
* Common UI conventions
* Identifying problems you can fix
* Your competitions' unique seling points
* Your [purple cow](http://www.sethgodin.com/purple/)
* A beginning list of users' needs
* How well your competitors are doing

Now is a great time to get your existing or potential users involved in the design process. Usability benchmark testing may be used on your [competitors products](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/2015/01/05/benchmarking/) to get an idea of how they empower users to complete basic goal-oriented tasks. Give the users you are testing a goal-oriented and basic task.

###One-on-one Interviews

> Start off with general questions and save the detailed questions for when the conversation is started. If you develop a good rapport with the participant, the interview is more likely to uncover information from unanticipated areas. You’ll always want the participant to lead the conversation because of this aspect.

Conducting one-on-one interviews is most effective when you have prepared yourself to ensure you can formulate questions that will determine:

* when the target users will use our app
* where they will use our app
* why they will use our app
* how they will use our app

EXAMPLE EXAMPLE EXAMPLE

These interviews are an effective way to get a lot of data about our potential users' needs. Later in this process we will analyze this data, so make sure you get permission from the participant to record the interview. Audio is good, video is best. A lot is said in body language that you might miss during the live interview.

Be aware that there are some limitations to these interviews. These limitations include:

* The answers to your questions are guesses about how the participant *thinks* they will use the product.
* These interviews are expensive, both in terms of money and time.

Determine the best way to interview your target users, whether it is onsite and in-person (best), in person at your office, or over a video chat service of your users choosing. Sitepoint has an excellent article on how to prepare and interview a target user that includes:

* Building trust by explaining the purpose of the video and how results will be used.
* Focusings around the participant's pain points.
* Determining if they would pay for your product.
* Having a second person analyze the interview.

###Focus Groups

Focus groups are an efficient way to test our initial ideas and assumptions from our research so far. They also facilitate identifying relevant market segments and acquiring more delicious data on our users' needs. We must be careful that we don't only rely on data collected from focus groups, as they too have their limitations that include:

![1984 quote](http://betterlivingthroughbeowulf.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1984.jpg)

* Relatively low number of participants (when compared with surveys for example).
* Participants' speculation during the session.
* Group think.

> Focus groups provide high-level feedback that helps you to make strategic decisions. When you are getting to the point where you have to make very specific, tactical design decisions, it is time to move on to more reliable research methods. - [uxmatters](http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/07/dos-and-donts-for-focus-groups.php#sthash.iS3nrOSi.dpuf)

Duke University has an [excellent guide](https://assessment.trinity.duke.edu/documents/How_to_Conduct_a_Focus_Group.pdf) on preparing for and conducting focus group interviews.

An excellent way to save money if you are in [bootstrap mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping) is to use a tool like [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com), [Blab.im](https://blab.im), [Appear.in](https://appear.in) or another [group video tool](http://www.azsmartoffice.com/articles/2015/livestreaming-for-business) to conduct your focus group studies.

###Surveys
The goal with surveys is to get respondents to understand your question in the exact same way so they may easily respond. This will help you avoid errors in your measuremet and analysis later.

Some quick tips for creating survey questions:

Don’t make open-ended questions mandatory.
Don't ask two questions disguised as one.
Don't be too vague.

#Defining The Problem
![Defining the Problem Illustration - Green](http://imgur.com/HIzRsJz)

> The first step in solving a problem is to recognize that it does exist.
> - Zig Ziglar

Design is the process of planning a way to produce a product that solves a problem in the [user experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design). The product definition phase is the cornerstone of our entire product and sets the stage for the success of our product. Every solution we design will be built upon the framework of this initial phase, this initial problem. That means we need to start with a problem that we work to understand and define.

![Design Process](http://imgur.com/9aS3pIW)
Photo Credit: Marcin Treder, [UXPin](https://www.uxpin.com/)

Let's go through the process of designing an app around a problem. It is always fun to be a designer on a project that deals with a problem you can relate to, so [I](https://twitter.com/ryanallen_com) will choose a problem that myself and the majority of people I know have. The problem of having [too much stress](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/01/stressed-america.aspx). I did some quick and dirty research by calling up a dozen friends and asking if it was a problem they felt they also had. Nine out of the 12 people interviewed said they experience the same problem. I suspect three of those 12 people are super-secret Zen monks.

Of course, I didn't have to call them up. I could've just sent this [5 minute survey](http://goo.gl/forms/WtjuvsIopY) (which you can feel free to take too) to get a sense of the problem.

Now that we have perceived a problem to design an app around we can define it in a [problem statement, or definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_statement) — a statement that captures the scope of the problem we are trying to solve. In this chapter, we'll dive deep into how to write a well-crafted statement that communicates to the team why the problem is critical to solve.

As a designer fortunate enough to get to work with some [incredible teams building mobile apps](http://dappergentlemen.com/), I get to hear a lot about what other people think about the way many apps are designed and function. There are so many great examples of well designed apps available, it makes finding inspiration easy and enjoyable. Not every app is a pillar of stellar design though, every now and then I hear about one that got everything wrong.

Recently my wife was telling me about an app she was trying to use to assist her with some of the fun things associated with newborn humans, and said:

**"This is a bad app."**

My designer's ears pricked up at the sound of a problem.

"What's that dear? You have a problem that needs solving?"

"No, I'm trying to tell you a story. Can't you just empathize with me and let me finish?" she probably implored.

"Of course I'll help you!" I exclaimed. "First we need to understand your perceived problem at a deeper level."

*An audible sigh came from somewhere in the room.*

Many people don't know how to begin solving their user's problem because they don't take the time to [listen](https://medium.com/@ryanallen_com/become-a-better-designer-and-person-by-learning-to-listen-f23ef9bef9b2) and really consider their problem. This is usually true not because the person is lazy, rather they just don't know how to go about thinking about the problem on a deeper level in an effort to understand what is causing it. The design process has to start somewhere though, and that starting point is usually our perceived problem. The perceived problem my wife was having (apart from my listening and empathizing skills) was that the app she was trying to use was a bad app. 

To recap, here is what we need to do when a problem is perceived: 

* **Acknowledge there is a problem.** First things first, we must understand that there is a problem. You can't solve it without saying that it exists. Brushing it under the rug does nothing for you or for your users.  

* **Listen and consider.** Don't just jump to wanting to solve the problem. You have to listen to your users — think about my interaction with my wife — to really understand what's going on. Asking follow up questions is fine, but don't just try to suggest a solution before you really understand what's going on.

Let's go back to our original problem as an example: **I have too much stress.**

Well, the problem of having too much stress is probably too general to design a solution around. As is the problem of an app being bad. This is where you need to probe deeper, asking more questions: How many ways can you fix a bad app? [All the ways](https://www.google.com/search?q=all+the+things&client=safari&rls=en&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=0CB0QsARqFQoTCNbtzLio_ccCFcyVDQodU4kNiQ&biw=1987&bih=1169) probably. How many [different ways can you think of to manage stress](http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/tips-to-control-stress)? Are overall app design and amounts of stress our real problems, or are they symptoms of deeper problems?

###What Are the Symptoms? 

A symptom is a [subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia) departure from normal function or feeling which is noticed by a user. For example, the feeling (feelings are subjective, not [objective](https://www.lib.odu.edu/genedinfolit/1infobasics/subjective_vs_objective.html)) of being tired (departure from the normal of being awake during the day) is a symptom (a subjective departure from the norm) of not getting enough sleep.

Our feeling of too much stress is a subjective departure from our normal function of not being too stressed. It also has many different ways we could deal with it, such as having a glass of wine at night, or a bottle, or listening to music, or watching TV. Maybe you know someone who has huge [meltdowns](http://giphy.com/gifs/b7nugvA2NwPbW) and [throws tantrums](http://giphy.com/gifs/12BQVyMqxgVNvy) as a way of letting off steam. Maybe you sit in a quiet place and breathe deeply and try to figure out what is causing you to feel stressed. Many people don't even recognize that they are stressed, which means it's not easy to recognize what is causing it. 

Is having too much stress really our problem? It seems like it is just a symptom of a much deeper problem. In order to solve the perceived problem of having too much stress, we need to think about the problem to determine if it is a root cause or merely a symptom of something [deeper](http://zoomquilt.org/). 

###What is the Root Cause? 

Why is it important to find the root cause of the problem? It's important because solving a symptom isn't a permanent solution.

For example, if your [leg hurts](http://giphy.com/gifs/adventure-time-upvote-whatever-PzlRZCKCmTVjq) you could take aspirin to dull the pain, but you will not be fixing the root cause of the pain, and so you will continue to experience the pain which is a symptom of the real problem. If you went to the doctor complaining about the pain and she determined that your leg hurt because you broke a bone, you could address the broken bone, which is the root cause of the pain problem. 

So how do we determine the root cause of our perceived problem of too much stress? We can use something developed at Toyota during the design of its manufacturing methodologies known as the [Five Whys Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys).

The [Five Whys Technique](http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf) is an iterative question-asking technique we will use to explore the [cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_and_Effect_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)) relationships underlying our perceived problems. This will enable us to find the root cause of our perceived problem. What was my wife confused about again? Something about an app she was trying to use I think.

**"This is a bad app. Also you could do a better job at listening to me when I'm trying to tal.."**

..oh yeah that's right. She couldn't figure out how to use a productivity app to help her manage some of the fun things that are associated with having a newborn. Things like the amount of poopy diapers, ounces of milk consumed, etc. In an effort to identify the deeper problem with the app I suggested we go through the **Five Whys** process.

1. Why is it a bad app?  
...because it doesn't work the right way. (refined problem)  
2. Why doesn't it work the right way?  
...because I don't understand where to go. (refined problem)  
3. Why don't you understand where to go?  
...because none of these icons make sense. (refined problem)  
4. Why don't the icons make sense?   
...because they don't take me where I think they should. (refined problem)  
5. Why don't they take you where you think they should?  
...because some of them that I think are icons, actually aren't, and the ones that are icons aren't ones I've ever seen before. (alterable behaviors identified)  

![5 Whys Bad App](http://imgur.com/lQkfHl7) [img link](https://live.uxpin.com/a90cab34ba53e8a0c1ace56e3306e1db34c977d7#/pages/29028128)

The root cause of my wife's problem has been identified very quickly, which I can send to the app's design team in an effort to help them improve the user experience. How can we be sure we have identified a root cause? They key to understanding the root cause of the problem (*it isn't always answered with the 5th why*) is in **identifying a broken process or an alterable behavior**. Sometimes there are more than one you will identify, like in the app we are going to design to help with the **problem of too much stress**.

1. Why do I have too much stress?  
...because I have too many stressful thoughts. (refined problem)  
2. Why do I have so many stressful thoughts?  
...because I can not calm my thoughts. (refined problem)  
3. Why am I unable to calm my mind? 
...because I don't practice calming my mind. (refined problem)  
4. Why am I unable to practice calming my mind?  
...because I don't have a process to calm my mind. (broken process identified)  
5. Why do I not have a process to calm my mind?  
...because I'm not aware of myself enough to know I need one. (deeper broken process identified)  

![5 Whys Too Much Stress](http://imgur.com/7nDoYUi) [img link](https://live.uxpin.com/a90cab34ba53e8a0c1ace56e3306e1db34c977d7#/pages/29024803)

The root cause of the perceived problem of having too much stress is not possessing a process to practice calming and focusing our mind. In this example, calming my thoughts would lead to less stress, which solves the original problem. We can evolve our problem definition now.

##Redefining the Problem
![Redefining the Problem - Purple](http://imgur.com/1P0IvDY)

**New Problem Definition:**  
*to enable users to calm their mind in an effort to reduce their stress*.

What about the deeper problem of not being more aware of our true [self](http://www.wired.com/2012/05/the-self-illusion-an-interview-with-bruce-hood/)? Sometimes a product will benefit from attempts to solve a deeper broken processes than may be necessary. By designing a solution with a deeper and more abstract problem definition we should still be solving the original symptom with the benefit of solving additional symptoms.

Throughout the design process we will continue to evolve the problem definition, so if we find we have gone too deep we can abstract back up one level. Let's go ahead and redefine our problem definition:

**Redefined Problem Definition**:  
*to enable users to realize their true selves in an effort to become more mindful, reduce their stress, and become better people.*.

Here are a couple of ways you can probe deeper into a design problems with your team, as discussed in the e-book [The Guide to UX Design Process and Documentation](https://www.uxpin.com/guide-to-ux-design-process-and-documentation.html):

* **Brainstorm on the problem**. You can get your team together on the perceived problem, having everyone on the team — from designers to developers to marketers to business analysts to sales — participate. Now while it'll be up to the designer ultimately to solve the design problems, teammates from other departments can provide other insights that will help frame your work. After all, sales may be closer to users and have a deeper understanding of their problems while a business analysts may have insights into the market. 

* **Researching the problem**. You can conduct a competitive marketing analysis to determine if this problem is being faced elsewhere. You can also conduct a user survey (like the one we did early on stress). If it's an existing product, dig through your analytics, heuristics, content, or conduct users tests. 

Doing these things will go a long way to getting to what's causing your problem, its root cause and how to solve it. 

Let's take a look at a few apps and their problem statements:

![Enlight Mobile App](http://imgur.com/xGDoOye)

According to [Stav Tishler](https://www.enlightapp.com/blog/author/stav/) from [Enlight](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id930026670?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4), their mobile app's problem definition is:

*“To empower the mobile photographer with creative tools, that until now, were reserved only for professionals and only on desktop.”*

Enlight solves this problem through the synergy of design and technology. Lightricks' proprietary image processing engine powers the tools that are tied together with a consistent UI that allow the users to transfer the knowledge they acquire by learning one tool, to other tools.

![Pure Chat Mobile App](http://imgur.com/G1JXFBT)

According to [Hamid Shojaee](https://twitter.com/hamids), [Pure Chat](https://www.purechat.com/) CEO, their mobile app's problem definition is:

*“To enable small business owners who are on the move to be able to communicate with visitors on their websites.”*

Maintaining 4.5 stars on the [Apple](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pure-chat-live-chat-for-ios/id719270614?mt=8) and [Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.axosoft.PureChat&hl=en) mobile app stores is a pretty good indicator that they have designed a great solution for the problem they set out to solve.

![Crowd Mics Mobile App](http://imgur.com/pdph3ec)

According to [Tim Holladay](https://twitter.com/timholladay), [Crowd Mics](http://crowdmics.com/) CEO, their mobile app's problem definition is:

*“To enable users who have a voice to be heard in the conference, meeting or any live event in which they are attending.”*

Crowd Mics turns the users' smartphones into wireless microphones for use in live events.

Once you write a really strong problem statement, don't feel like you're married to it. As you go along the design process, you'll find that you may have to redefine your problem. That's because you'll discover things as you go along that weren't apparently in the early discovery phase of the process.
