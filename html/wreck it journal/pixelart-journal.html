<p>As a totally radical kid born in the 80s, video games were a major part of my life. My best friend's father was a computer programmer who was working on things so complex and mindblowing I still don't fully understand them. He was always bringing home and sharing the latest computer games with his kids, which worked out pretty swell for me living next door! Back then the games were all CGA (4 colors) and EGA (16 colors), which always fascinated me. How were the artists able to create such realistic images with such limitations? I assumed they were magicians, but I've since learned it was through te power of hard-work and dedication to their crafts.</p>

<p>35 years later and low resolution digital artwork continues to fascinate and inspire me. Creating an image with a limited pallet and resolution is a fun and creative way to view the world and the objects within it. For my journal project I wanted to draw a happy child in a way that was similar to how it would be done on an older 8 bit video game console. A maximum resolution of 32 by 32, and less than 8 colors. Black and white count as colors by the way.</p>

<p>In order to achieve this I'm using a notebook with a dot grid since it makes it easier by allowing me to connect the dots for my grid, though it's not required. My tools are:

<ul>
<li>Leuchtturn1917 notebook</li>
<li>Rotring .5mm pencil</li>
<li>Putty eraser</li>
<li>Colored pencils</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Draw a Grid</h2>
<p>You can work with any sized grid you want. The smaller the resolution the simpler the drawing. I will be working with a grid sized at 24 units wide by 32 units tall.

<p>Here are some examples drawn on a 16 x 16 grid.

<h2>Next, Sketch Your Character Over the Grid</h2>
<p>By doing a quick sketch of your character over the grid you can very quickly get an idea of which blocks will be colored in. Here is my character over the grid.

<h2>Finally, Fill in the Pixels With Your Choice of Colors</h2>
<p>The final step is adding colors. Color in the appropriate blocks and erase your extra pencil lines. Finish it all off by adding a single pixel black border around the drawing to make it pop off the background.<br>

<p>That's it! Try some of your own drawings and post them for everyone to see! :D</p>
