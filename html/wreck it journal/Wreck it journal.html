Wreck it journal

I've been thinking a lot recently about how to tech more difficult concepts to a younger person. It might have something to do with haing kids of my own, though who is to say for sure ;) I was recently thinking about how to explain to my 2-year-old daughter how to think about objects in the world and how to represent those objects with a pen and a piece of paper. I don't know how many two year olds youve spoken with recently but their ability to hold a conversation longer a few word is pretty low. I spent elven minutes today trying to explain to my daughter why toothbrushes arent for cleaning butts before finally aceeding to her point that yes, it is a brush, and yes, brushes clean things. That reminds me I should buy new toothbrushes tomorrow. 

So how would I go about telling someone who doesn't understand the difference between teeth and poop how to represent those things on a piece of paper with only a pen? After weeks of experimentation I have found that she understands basic shapes and how they are formed inside of objects. This simple concept of shapes is learned so young that we literrally have our entire lives spent in practicing it, and it is this idea that has my daughter running up to shapes within objects and screaming out 'DADA SCARE!' as I hold back a laugh and pull her away from funny thing here made up of squares.

For my project I want to represent objects with only squares. A square has 4 equal sides and all corners equal 90 degrees. No rectangles.
