What is Design?
---------------

Design happens when a human being observes or senses a problem, or a gap where the user experience is negatively impacted, and they define the problem, explore alternatives, and make a four-step iterative process to solve that problem.

======================================================

Plan
====
*Problem Definition:* What are the problems?
*Exploration:* Research all the ways the problem can be solved. Exploration is fundamentaly divergent to understand the full space of possibilities.
*Select the Plan:* Converge your ideas to the best solutions.

Establish expectations for the artifact in a [spec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_(technical_standard)), which is also something you will improve upon later.
