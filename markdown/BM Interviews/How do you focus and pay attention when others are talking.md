I have a question. How are you able, by that I mean what are you consciously doing to control the situation, to remain so focused and attentive when listening to others talk?

I have convinced myself that everything is interesting, and no matter how dull or false something appears I will discover that there is something I might learn.
Omfg that's genius. Until this moment I hadn't made that connection!
Next question
How do you remember that then it is important?

I am having trouble parsing that last sentence
How do you remember that there is something interesting to learn during an important conversation with someone when focusing is difficult due to circumstances outside your control, like health problems and other stressors.

Think about your thoughts as you have them so that you lose the feeling that you are the author of them and that is you.  Send them back to your subconsciousness any time it's being a little bitch.

"No, give me a new thought"

You know how you can gain an awareness of your breathing when you think about it and you can control that

Think about your thoughts like that

as an automatic flow of bullshit you can control by practicing staying aware of the process

When your thoughts tell you, "This is boring, lets play Hearthstone."  If you recognize that thought the same way as you would if it were a crackhead on the street making the suggestion, and not as your own, you can go, "You know what, fuck you." And then your subconscious will go, "No fuck you!" and it will release some hormones or whatever the fuck it does to give you an impulse to play Hearthstone, and you go, "Fuck you, you tricky bitch, I decided I'm going to watch this today and not play games."

I spend a lot of my time thinking about my thinking.
What is the ideal state you've found that is conducive to thinking about your thoughts?

If you don't fight your thoughts, and you think of them as your own, you are a slave to your subconscious and  you just get the benefit of feeling guilty and undisciplined later for going along with your monkey brain's ideas.  If you aren't thinking about thinking,  the consciousness might as well be a print out of your mental activity.  I can see no reason it would have evolved but to give us a way to consider why we are acting a particular way.  Something most people never think about.  Everyone thinks, "You hurt my feelings!  You make me mad!  You, you, you!"  The fact is, we are all responsible for our feelings and behaviors, and metacognition is the true self reflection

A lot of people say meditation is the way to go.  It's hard to explain how I do it.  It's sort of like a daydream where I'm having a conversation with myself.  A good way to begin is to think about core beliefs that you really can't see any other way and then you invite yourself to really consider the exact opposite, then find rational reasons to believe that position.  Sort of like playing devil's advocate.  You have to understand what kind of arguments are persuasive to you, so starting with your beliefs about truth / evidence is a good place to start tinkering

In the day dream, one of me the the subconcious, and the other me just calls the first me out on everything by asking why
It's pretty extreme how even though we are learning new things everything you tell me is a reclassification of something I'm thinking.
Thank you for being so engaging. I have a lot to think about.


Another way of looking at it is...You know how when you write/type an article/post/whatever, you look at it to revise/improve it before you take ownership of the ideas by sharing them, that's kind of what you do with your thoughts.  It's not about hesitating to make a choice though, it's challenging yourself to find reasons for the thoughts you are afraid to consider
You're very good at abstracting new and relative examples

meditation tapes

baked in audio

real audio with smart watch

---

you are not a real person. you are a collection of obervations made manifest in your consciousness stream.

---

my idea involves using that 3d audio as guided meditation based on a framework that is easy enough to put any message you want into that is easily marketed to women under the 'self improvement, mystical, perhaps hinting at the psychic or super-sensual, based on the amount of $ spent on psychic friends network. its like that only in app form.
