#The Problem

> The first step in solving a problem is to recognize that it does exist.
> - Zig Ziglar

Design is the process of planning a way to produce an [artifact](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/106473/what-does-artifact-mean) to solve a gap in the [user experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design). The first step in the UX design process is to recognize that there is [a gap](https://vimeo.com/85040589), or problem, for which you can design a solution. That means we need to start with a problem. A problem I often experience (and imagine many other's also experience) is that *I have [too much stress](http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/01/stressed-america.aspx)*. I did some quick and dirty research by calling up a dozen friends and asking if it was a problem they felt they also had. Nine out of the 12 people interviewed said they experience the same problem. I suspect three of those 12 people are super-secret Zen monks whose identities have been changed to protect them from the forces of evil the government sometimes hires them to combat. Their base of operations is probably at the bottom of the ocean, or [inside a volcano](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VolcanoLair). Is the feeling of too much stress a problem that you experience? Let me know in [this simple yes / no survey](CREATE A SURVEY DERP DE DERP).

Now that we have perceived a problem we can define it in a [problem definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_statement). A **problem definition** is a *statement that captures the scope of the problem we are trying to solve*.

##Perceiving the Problem

WRITE SOMETHING HERE ABOUT A DESIGN PROBLEM IN AN APP WHERE USERS ARENT READING AT NIGHT BECAUSE THE SCREEN IS TOO BRIGHT. SOLUTION IS TO MAKE IT BLACK. LIKE YOUR HEART.

**I have too much stress.**

The problem of having too much stress and wanting to reduce it is probably too general to design a solution around. How many [different ways can you think of to manage stress](http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/tips-to-control-stress)? 

###Symptom
A few different ways to deal with stress might be to have a glass of wine at night, or a bottle, or listen to music, or watch TV. Maybe you know someone who has huge [meltdowns](http://giphy.com/gifs/b7nugvA2NwPbW) and [throws tantrums](http://giphy.com/gifs/12BQVyMqxgVNvy) as a way of *letting off steam*. Maybe you sit in a quiet place and breathe deeply and try to figure out what is causing you to feel stressed. Many people don't even recognize that they are stressed, which means it's not easy to recognize what is causing it. Is having too much stress really our problem, or is it just a symptom of a much deeper problem? In order to solve the perceived problem of having too much stress, we need to think about the problem to determine if it is a root cause or merely a symptom of something [deeper](http://zoomquilt.org).

###Root Cause
Why is it important to find the [root cause]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause)) of the problem? It's important because solving a symptom isn't a permanent solution. If your [leg hurts](http://giphy.com/gifs/adventure-time-upvote-whatever-PzlRZCKCmTVjq) you could take aspirin to dull the pain, but you will not be fixing the root cause of the pain, and so you will continue to experience the pain which is a symptom of the real problem. If you went to the doctor complaining about the pain and she determined that your leg hurt because you broke a bone, you could address the broken bone, which is the root cause of the pain problem. Be careful not to let your doctor get too abstract in her analysis, you don't want her to determine the root cause of the pain to be your central nervous system. Removing that would probably cause many additional, though interesting, problems.

So how do we determine the root cause of our perceived problem? We can use something developed at Toyota during the design of its manufacturing methodologies known as the [Five Whys Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys).

##The Five Whys Technique

The [Five Whys Technique](http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27641/five-whys-technique.pdf) is an iterative question-asking technique we will use to explore the [cause and effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cause_and_Effect_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)) relationships underlying our perceived problem. This will enable us to find the root cause of our perceived problem:

**I have too much stress.**

Now it is time to start asking and answering the *whys*.

**1. Why do I have too much stress?**  
*...because I have too many stressful thoughts. (refined problem)*
**2. Why do I have so many stressful thoughts?**
*...because I can not calm my thoughts. (refined problem)*
**3. Why am I unable to calm my thoughts?**
*...because I don't practice calming my thoughts. (refined problem)*
**4. Why am I unable to practice calming my thoughts?**
*...because I don't have a process to calm my thoughts. (broken process identified)*
**5. Why do I not have a process to calm my thoughts?**
*...because I'm not [aware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awareness) of myself enough to know I need one. (refined problem)*

And so, the root cause of the perceived problem of having too much stress is not possessing a process to practice calming and focusing our thoughts. How do we know that is the root cause of my stress? They key to understanding the root cause of the problem (*it isn't always answered with the 5th why*) is in identifying a broken process or an alterable behavior. In this example, calming my thoughts would lead to less stress, which solves the original problem. We can evolve our problem definition now:

##Redefining the Problem

**New Problem Definition:**
*I want to calm my thoughts in an effort to reduce my [stress]((http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-symptoms/art-20050987)).*

What about the problem of not being more aware of our true [self](http://www.wired.com/2012/05/the-self-illusion-an-interview-with-bruce-hood/)?

On a deeper level, designing a solution to allow us to experience our true would also reduce stress, as well as helping with other symptoms like [materialism](http://zenhabits.net/a-guide-to-escaping-materialism-and-finding-happiness/), [isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitude) and [antisocial issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder), [narcissism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stop-walking-eggshells/201112/interpersonal-exploitation-typical-narcissists) and [lack of empathy](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/stop-walking-eggshells/201201/lack-empathy-the-most-telling-narcissistic-trait), etc. The process involved in practicing calming thoughts is a step involved in the process of understanding our true selves, so we aren't hurting the project by going deeper than our first identified process breakdown. It could be an interesting design problem delve deeper than we need to, and I think it is one that is worth exploring. Many times it is beneficial to attempt to solve a problem that is a little more difficult than you are [comfortable with](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/comfort-zone), both in terms of growing as a designer and in terms of designing a more interesting product. Throughout the design process we will continue to evolve the problem definition, so if we find we have [gone too deep](http://giphy.com/gifs/loop-infinite-tea-fWZvYFCh4oyl2) we can abstract back up one level. Let's go ahead and redefine our problem definition:

**Newer Problem Definition:**
*I want to become more aware of my true self in an effort to calm my thoughts, reduce my stress, and become a better person.*

Now that we know what problem we want to solve it's time to start doing more research.
